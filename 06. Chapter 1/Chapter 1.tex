\textbf{Half page aims:}
We hypothesised human IFITs to be induced by human RSV infection, and due to species cross protection not being induced by bRSV. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following the treatment of known innate immune system activators such as interferons, LPS, and poly I:C. These would also allow us to assess the  We would then assess the IFIT induction during human and bovine RSV infection using a range of viral concentrations and end assay time points. Lastly, we would validate this data in more physiologically relevant cell lines..

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:Discussion Chapter 1}
Recap human induction \newline
Interestingly, the maximal induction of \textit{hIFIT5} observed in this study seems to be 10-16 fold, an order of magnitude lower than what is observed for the other \textit{hIFIT}.
