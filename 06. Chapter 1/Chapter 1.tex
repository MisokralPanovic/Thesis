As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Interferon-Induced Proteins with Tetratricopeptide Repeats}, \textit{IFIT} gene family are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are generally activated early in antiviral response. Their transcription is mainly regulated via interferon-stimulated response elements (IRSE), activated by ISGF3 and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7. In short, these are activated downstream of interferon receptor signalling cascades, and via intracellular and extracellular recognition of PAMPs. As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:IFIT Responses to Viral Infections}, human IFITs are also known to restrict a plethora of viruses. The examples include IFIT1 and IFIT3 caused restriction of PIV3 (\cite{Rabbani2016Identification3}), and more significantly IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 caused restiction of human RSV (\cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}). In the latter, it was shown that overexpression of these IFITs negatively influences human RSV replication kinetics, while the silencing of \textit{hIFIT1}, \textit{hIFIT2}, and \textit{hIFIT3} caused the opposite effect. Clearly, IFITs seem to have an important role in the RSV life cycle which should be investigated further. It is not known, however, if \textit{hIFITs} are indeed induced following RSV infection and thus able to negatively influence RSV replication in homeostatic pathophysiological conditions.

We hypothesised human \textit{IFITs} to be induced by human RSV infection, which would allow them to enact their antiviral roles as were shown before in the literature. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following the treatment of known innate immune system activators such as interferons, LPS (extracellular PAMP), and poly I:C (intracellular PAMP). These assays also allowed us to decipher which innate immune response pathways are responsible for \textit{IFIT} induction. Further, we assessed the \textit{IFITs} induction by hRSV as a function of concentration and time of infection. Lastly, we investigated the potential of species cross-protection protection by assessing \textit{hIFIT} induction by bovine RSV infection. All data was also validated in more physiologically relevant cell lines.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions Chapter 1}
Our experiments show that ...

cells capable of induction but beas2b less. 

a549 and beas2b responsive to ifna, although beas2b less. a549 - 1 highest 5 lowest; beas2b 2 highest 5 lowest
lps doesn't not stimulate much
ifng stimulates all ifits equally
transfected polu IC induces the most, although possible that this is mediated via paracrine ifn secretion

ifits are not responsive to low moi hrsv infection, and are capable of maintaining its expression during the 48 HOI. with the exception of ifit1 response is concentration and time dependant.

induction is caused the virus and not cellular contaminants; this is greatly diminished following pharmacological blockage of interferon receptor, and abloshed when virus is cross linked (in a549)
- suggesting induction is viral replication dependant and mediated via paracrine interferon signalling
- this data recapitulated in beas2b with the exception of magnitude of induction (was lower during ifna as well) and requiring interferon signaling for basal ifit expression

a549 gets induced drastically by both WT and mutant brsv, low and high MOI
beas2b did not induce by brsv wt, but by mutant brsv yes (although low moi)




------------------------------------------------------------



both hrsv and brsv induce ifits. in human we know its dependant on viral replication and subsequent ifn signalling. we can assume that with brsv it works the same.

although pIC induces loads, replicating rsv withour IFN receptor doesnt, suggesting that even with poly IC what we see is IFN mediated



Interestingly, the maximal induction of \textit{hIFIT5} observed in this study seems to be 10-16 fold, an order of magnitude lower than what is observed for the other \textit{hIFIT}.

its weird that different ifit have different regulation, also between cell lines. i1 is different, i2 and i3 similar and i5 super different. could be different genomic regulation

clearly rsv can induce human ifits and thus they can negatively influence it. the question is, through what mechanism?
