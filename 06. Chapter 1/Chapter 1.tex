\textbf{Half page aims:}
We hypothesised both human and bovine IFITs to be induced by human and bovine RSV infection. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following the treatment of known innate immune system activators such as interferons, LPS, and poly I:C. These would also allow us to assess the  We would then assess the IFIT induction during human and bovine RSV infection using a range of viral concentrations and end assay time points. Lastly, we would validate this data in more physiologically relevant cell lines as well as using omics approaches.
