As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Interferon-Induced Proteins with Tetratricopeptide Repeats}, the \textit{IFIT} gene family are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are generally activated early in the antiviral response. Their transcription is mainly regulated via interferon-stimulated response elements (IRSE), activated by ISGF3 and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 (Figure \ref{fig:Pathways Inducing ISG mRNA Production.}). In short, these are activated downstream of interferon receptor signalling cascades, and via intracellular and extracellular recognition of PAMPs. As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:IFIT Responses to Viral Infections}, human IFITs are also known to restrict a plethora of viruses. The examples include IFIT1 and IFIT3 restriction of PIV3 (\cite{Rabbani2016Identification3}), and more significantly IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 restiction of human RSV (\cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}). In the latter, it was shown that overexpression of these IFITs negatively effects human RSV replication kinetics, while the silencing of \textit{hIFIT1}, \textit{hIFIT2}, and \textit{hIFIT3} caused the opposite effect. Clearly, IFITs seem to have an important role in the RSV life cycle which should be investigated further. It is not known, however, if \textit{hIFITs} are indeed induced following RSV infection and thus able to negatively influence RSV replication in homeostatic pathophysiological conditions.

We hypothesised human \textit{IFITs} to be induced by human RSV infection, which would allow them to enact their antiviral roles as previously shown in the literature. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following treatment with known innate immune system activators such as interferons, LPS (extracellular PAMP), and poly I:C (intracellular PAMP). These assays also allowed us to decipher which innate immune response pathways are responsible for \textit{IFIT} induction. Further, we assessed \textit{IFITs} induction by hRSV as a function of concentration and time of infection. Lastly, we investigated the potential of species cross-protection by assessing \textit{hIFIT} induction by bovine RSV infection. All data was also validated in more physiologically relevant cell lines.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions Chapter 1}
Our experiments demonstrate the induction of human \textit{IFITs} in both A549 and BEAS2B cell lines, although the induction's magnitude in BEAS2B appears more moderate. Notably, both cell lines exhibit a time-dependent response to IFN alpha stimulation in an inverse manner. Interestingly, the varying induction magnitudes of \textit{IFITs} between the cell lines reveal that while \textit{IFIT5} shows the lowest induction levels in both cell lines, A549 has \textit{IFIT1} as the highest-induced IFIT, contrasting with BEAS2B, where \textit{IFIT2} was induced to the highest level. Additional A549 experiments show that LPS incubation stimulates \textit{IFIT} induction, but the magnitude, especially in comparison to other stimulants, seems biologically insignificant. Remarkably, IFN\(\gamma\) consistently stimulates \textit{IFIT} induction in a concentration-independent manner, displaying a uniform induction magnitude across various \textit{IFITs} — a trait not observed with other stimulations. Moreover, transfected poly I:C induces \textit{IFITs} to levels surpassing those elicited by other tested innate immune system stimulants.

Further, we confirmed that high MOI hRSV infection, but not low MOI infection, induces \textit{hIFIT} expression. We observed a concentration and time-dependent effect, which was maintained for at least 48 HPI, for all \textit{hIFITs} but \textit{hIFIT1}, which nevertheless showed the most robust induction out of all the genes tested. We confirmed that this induction isn't due to cellular contaminants from the viral preparation step, as infecting cells with purified virus induced similar patterns of gene expression.  In A549, this induction was greatly diminished following pharmacological blockage of the interferon receptor, and completely abolished by UV-inactivation of hRSV, indicating the necessity of RSV replication for the initial \textit{IFIT} induction and functional interferon signalling for a robust \textit{IFIT} response. Most likely infected cells initiate an innate immune response, which also induces \textit{IFIT} locally and results in interferon production. This is then sensed by surrounding cells by paracrine interferon signalling, which in turn prophylactically induces \textit{IFIT} in those cells. This data was mirrored in the BEAS2B cell line, with minor discrepancies in the overall magnitude of \textit{IFIT} induction—aligning with the induction potential by hIFN$\alpha$—and apparent \textit{IFIT} downregulation in cells infected with hRSV while the interferon receptor was pharmacologically inhibited. This suggests the requirement of basal interferon sensing for the observed basal \textit{IFIT} expression in mock-treated cells. Intriguingly, the induction observed by transfection of poly I:C wasn't observed when infecting cells with hRSV while inhibiting the interferon receptor, hinting at the induction during poly I:C transfection being caused by subsequent interferon signaling, not solely internal poly I:C detection.

In A549, both bRSV WT and mutants induced \textit{hIFIT} expression, irrespective of the presence or absence of SH, NS1, or NS2 proteins. Notably, very low MOI $\Delta$NS infections induced \textit{hIFIT}, contrary to low MOI hRSV infection. The observations of high magnitude \textit{hIFIT} induction, and following observations from hRSV infections, suggest bRSV-mediated \textit{hIFIT} mRNA expression increase being mediated by viral replication and paracrine interferon signalling. Intriguingly, the BEAS2B cell line exhibited \textit{IFIT} induction only in $\Delta$NS2 and double mutant $\Delta$NS1/2 bRSV, suggesting BEAS2B ISGs' insensitivity to bRSV infection, unlike what was observed in the A549 cell line. Literature suggests that hRSV and bRSV are confined to their respective hosts \textit{in vivo} (\cite{Buchholz2000ChimericVaccine}), potentially explained by \textit{hIFIT} induction as a result of infection, indicating that the A549 cell line more closely mimics species cross-protection expectations.

Another intriguing observation from this part of the study is the differential induction patterns among \textit{IFITs} when responding to stimuli. In A549, \textit{IFIT1} consistently emerges as the highest inducer, while \textit{IFIT2} and \textit{IFIT3} show similar induction patterns and magnitudes. In the BEAS2B cell line, these patterns remain fairly similar, but at times \textit{IFIT1} isn't the highest inducer. \textit{hIFIT5} seems to be consistently the worst induced IFIT in both cell lines. Notably, the maximal induction of \textit{hIFIT5} observed in this study seems 10-16 fold, an order of magnitude lower than what's observed for other \textit{hIFITs}. While the literature indicates that IFITs should share genomic regulatory elements (\cite{Lou2009Ifr-9/stat2Stat1}), our data suggests potential differences in promoter and enhancer activity. Overall, RSV infection, regardless of species, is capable of robust \textit{hIFIT} induction, potentially enabling \textit{hIFITs} to exhibit their antiviral activity against RSV. Are bovine \textit{IFITs} responding similarly to hRSV and bRSV, and ultimately, what is the mechanism of RSV fitness reduction by IFITs?
