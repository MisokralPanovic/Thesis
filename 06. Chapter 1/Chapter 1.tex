\chapter{Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV} \label{ch:Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV}
\section{Introduction and Aims} \label{sec:Introduction and Aims-Chapter 1}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:Introduction} Section \ref{sec:Interferon-Induced Proteins with Tetratricopeptide Repeats}, \textit{IFIT} gene family are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are generally activated early in antiviral response. Their transcription is mainly regulated via interferon-stimulated response elements (IRSE), activated by ISGF3 and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7. In short, these are activated downstream of interferon receptor signalling cascades, and via intracellular and extracellular recognition of PAMPs. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:Introduction} Section \ref{sec:Interferon-Induced Proteins with Tetratricopeptide Repeats} Subsection \ref{subsec:IFIT Responses to Viral Infections},human IFITs are also known to restrict a plethora of viruses. The examples include IFIT1 and IFIT3 caused restriction of PIV3 (\cite{Rabbani2016Identification3}), and more significantly IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 caused restiction of human RSV (\cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}). In the latter it was shown that overexpression of these IFITs negativelly influences human RSV replication kinetics, while the silencing of \textit{hIFIT1}, \textit{hIFIT2}, and \textit{hIFIT3} caused the opposite effect. Clearly, IFITs seem to have a important role in RSV life cycle which should be investigated further. It is not know, however, if \textit{hIFITs} are indeed induced following RSV infection and thus able to negatively influence RSV replication in homeostatic pathophysiological conditions.

We hypothesised human \textit{IFITs} to be induced by human RSV infection, which would allow them to enact their antiviral roles as were shown before in the literature. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following the treatment of known innate immune system activators such as interferons, LPS (extracellular PAMP), and poly I:C (intracellular PAMP). These assays also allowed us to decipher which innate immune response pathways are responsible for \textit{IFIT} induction. Further, we assessed the \textit{IFITs} induction by hRSV as a function of concentration and time of infection. Lastly we investigated the potential of species cross-protection protection by assessing \textit{hIFIT} induction by bovine RSV infection. All data was also validated in more physiologically relevant cell line.

Recap human induction
Interestingly, the maximal induction of \textit{hIFIT5} observed in this study seems to be 10-16 fold, an order of magnitude lower than what is observed for the other \textit{hIFIT}.
