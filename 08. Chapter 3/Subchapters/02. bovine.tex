Data showing that bIFITs are not differentially expressed in cells infected with dSH bRSV.

This is a dataset that was present in Dalan`s group. Comparing responses at 16 and 40 HPI between WT bRSV vs Mock and dSH bRSV vs Mock. The dataset was previously analysed by a bioinformatician in Pirbright which yield 0 differentially expressed host genes. He however included viral genes in the analysis, which I assume affected the adjusted p values of the host genes due to the relative viral genes abundance. We tried to get in touch with him to discuss this but after several emails got no response. The re-analysis was done on raw annotated count data which had viral transcripts removed. Original analysis was done using EdgeR package, my re-analysis was with DESeq2 (both are valid way of doing DE analysis, EdgeR is more modular and harder to use).

All 4 volcano plots, showing bi1-5 and bmx1, regardless where they are

afterwards i would do a paragraph of the analysis as I did it so why not
