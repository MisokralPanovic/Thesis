In the follow up experiment, exogenous bovine IFIT2 in the context of human RSV infection shows the same two phenotypes. It is either excluded from the IBs (middle panel) or colocalises with the ring structure of the IBs (top and bottom panel; highlighted with arrows).

Very similar phenotype is observed for overexpressed bIFIT3-FLAG in bRSV infected cells. We see colocalization with IB (top panel) as well as exclusion from the structure without any signs of IFIT3 signal on the periphery of the IB structure (bottom panel).

\subsubsection{OE IFIT5}
hIFIT5-FLAG is colocalising with hRSV inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining), while in bRSV infected cell there is a hint of IFIT5 signal concentration at the side of bRSV IB.

This data is by single cells per conditions as transfection did not work well. It is however supported by z stack measurements.

\subsubsection{Summary} \label{Summary-oe}
Overexpressed hIFIT1-FLAG in the context of h/bRSV infection colocalises to both human and bovine IB structures.

Overexpressed bIFIT3 behaves equally between hRSV and bRSV infection, that is it sometimes colocalises with the IB structure and sometimes is completely excluded from the structure.

Overexpressed hIFIT5 in hRSV infected cells colocalises with the IBs.
