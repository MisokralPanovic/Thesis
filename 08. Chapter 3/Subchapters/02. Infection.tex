\subsubsection{Phenotypic Diversity of Nascent Human and Bovine IFIT1 Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}
following a hint of interaction with ibs for some ifits, we went to systematically assess the interaction of all ifits

ifit one, although being predominantly excluded or duffuesd through ibs (suggesting no interaction), is often observed to interact with these structures

inclusion and coloc + eclusion happens in larger ibs (probs more mature), suggesting temporal nature of ifit one interaction

\subsubsection{Summary} \label{Summary-infection}
In the context of infection, endogenous human IFIT1 concentrates within the human RSV IB structure; colocalises to the edge of the IB; is diffused through the structure and cytoplasm equally; or is excluded from the structure. This suggests that the interaction between human IFIT1 and hRSV IB is dynamic and depends on factors that we do not understand yet. In the case of endogenous bovine IFIT1 in the context of bRSV IBs, IFIT1 is either excluded from the structure; excluded from the IB inner edge but concentrated inside; or excluded from the centre of IB structure but concentrated on the inner edge of the structure. 

Nascent human IFIT3 during hRSV infection is either excluded from IB structure or is diffused through the structure. Occasionally it colocalises to the IB ring. Nascent bIFIT3 during bRSV infection either siphons inside IBs and shows sub-IB granules or is excluded from the IB boundary with slightly decreased signal inside of the IB.

In human cells during hRSV infection IFIT5 is mainly excluded from the IBs but seems to concentrate on their edge. Once we saw colocalization with the IB ring and a concentration of IFIT5 inside it. In bovine cells IFIT5 is always excluded from the IB boundary and the signal inside is either slightly decreased or equal compared to cytoplasmic IFIT5.
