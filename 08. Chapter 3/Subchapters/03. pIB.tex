In the context of bovine pIB structures, nascent monkey IFIT1 seems to colocalise with the edges of the structures (highlighted by the arrows). Consistent to human pIB data, nascent monkey IFIT1 is excluded from filamentous pIB network.

\subsubsection{IFIT2 Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs}
%Single transfections
IFIT2 induction detected in hP and hP + hN conditions, suggesting that transfection of P induces IFIT2 expression (but this does not happen with IFIT1 or IFIT3 in the same cells).
About the different genomic regulation landscape… why does IFIT2 get induced but not other IFITs (within human genome which is well annotated)? 
Side note: No kinetochore microtubule staining (especially in first panel)

% summary
Both endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 forms inclusions inside human RSV pseudo-IBs. Monkey IFIT2 also colocalises to the pIB filamentous network (this structure was not observed in the human experiment). The identical staining can be observed in monkey cells with overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Endogenous monkey IFIT2 is excluded from human pIB and the pIB associated filamentous network. Overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG is detected by the antibody and shows inclusions inside the human pIB structures, which is consistent to data from IFIT2A staining and FLAG staining of IFIT2-FLAG overexpressed samples. Interestingly, IFIT2B antibody shows exclusion from the pIB filamentous network, which was colocalised by IFIT2A and FLAG antibodies.

\paragraph{Exogenous IFIT2-FLAG Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs}
Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures as well as the pIB filamentous network. In this experiment we are detecting both human and monkey IFIT2, however we can see a huge difference in IFIT2 expression between some cells (bottom panel; cells in the periphery of the picture), suggesting that what we are mainly detecting is the overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures but show exclusion from the pIB filamentous network (or partial colocalsiation?). This suggest that the IFIT2B antibody can indeed detect IFIT2 but the overexpressed IFIT2 observed between the inclusion and the one interacting with the filamentous network is somehow different (epitope masking?).

Exogenously expressed human IFIT2 colocalises with the pIB associated filamentous net (top panel). It also forms inclusion inside the human pIB structures. This data is consistent with what we observed with IFIT2A antibody. IFIT2 also seems to occasionally form aggregates/spots (highlighted by arrows). These could be functional or just aggregates caused by overexpression, we do not know.

% summary i2
We have described how bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant was designed based on the published human IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant data (needs to be annotated more). Overexpression of bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant yields cellular distribution and morphology similar to what was observed with overexpressing human IFIT2-FLAG, suggesting that the mutant proteins are not toxic to the cells. In the first experiment where we were looking at interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pseudo inclusion bodies we saw several phenotypes. We observed bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant being excluded from small and big pIBs and pIB associated filamentous network, while fully or partially colocalising with other pIBs. In a subsequent experiment we observed only colocalization and inclusion formation. When assessing the interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pIBs formed using wild-type human RSV P and GFP-tagged human RSV N, we observed consistently in two experiments that bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant colocalises to the pIB structures.

\subsubsection{Nascent Moneky IFIT3 and Its Interaction With pIBs}
Nascent monkey IFIT3 seems to behave a if he pIB was not here. This means I has diffused phenotype. One exception is the top panel (shown with the arrow) which hints at concentrated IFIT3 at the edge of the pIBs. We do not know the localisation with respect to the pIB filaments as none were found in the slides. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

\subsubsection{Nascent Moneky IFIT5 and Its Interaction With pIBs}
Nascent monkey IFIT5 colocalises with hRSV pseudo inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining). It also colocalises with pIB filamentous network. This network is only seen in cells that are co-transfected with RSV N and P proteins. We believe that they are an aftermath of a pIB breakdown. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

Panel (a) shows percentual proportions of observed phenotypes between hRSV pseudo inclusion bodies and monkey IFIT5 (100 observations), with the red dotted line denoting the 5\% threshold, marking phenotypes considered relevant above this limit. Panel (b) shows the IB area in \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) per observed relevant phenotype.}

Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI (yellow), and cells were double-labeled with anti-RSV N (cyan) and anti-IFIT5 (magenta) antibodies. This figure showcases representative examples of relevant phenotypes in the interaction between monkey IFIT5 and hRSV pseudo inclusion bodies. These phenotypes are presented in descending order based on their percentage proportions. The scale bar indicates 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}\).}

% summary
Endogenous human IFIT1 seems to be diffused through the human pIB structure. On the other hand, endogenous monkey IFIT1 forms an inclusion in human pIBs, colocalises with the edge of human and bovine pIBs and is excluded from the filamentous pIB network. This suggests that the colocalization is not caused by mere interaction with N or P but its dependant on the integrity of pIBs.

Endogenous monkey IFIT3 seems to be diffuse through the human pIB structures (with maybe a small hint of colocalization).

Endogenous monkey IFIT5 colocalises with human pIBs and with the NP network (this network is never present in infected cells, so we do not know how are other IFIT5s colocalising with it).
