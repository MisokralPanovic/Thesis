\subsection{Exogenous IFIT2-FLAG Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs and IBs} \label{subsec:Exogenous IFIT2-FLAG Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs and IBs}
\subsubsection{IFIT2-FLAG in a Simplified System of pseudo-IBs} \label{IFIT2-FLAG in a Simplified System of pseudo-IBs}
Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures as well as the pIB filamentous network. In this experiment we are detecting both human and monkey IFIT2, however we can see a huge difference in IFIT2 expression between some cells (bottom panel; cells in the periphery of the picture), suggesting that what we are mainly detecting is the overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures but show exclusion from the pIB filamentous network (or partial colocalsiation?). This suggest that the IFIT2B antibody can indeed detect IFIT2 but the overexpressed IFIT2 observed between the inclusion and the one interacting with the filamentous network is somehow different (epitope masking?).

Exogenously expressed human IFIT2 colocalises with the pIB associated filamentous net (top panel). It also forms inclusion inside the human pIB structures. This data is consistent with what we observed with IFIT2A antibody. IFIT2 also seems to occasionally form aggregates/spots (highlighted by arrows). These could be functional or just aggregates caused by overexpression, we do not know.

Exogenous bovine IFIT2 colocalises with the edge of human pIB structures. This is unusual as human IFIT2 data suggest inclusions with regards to pIBs.
