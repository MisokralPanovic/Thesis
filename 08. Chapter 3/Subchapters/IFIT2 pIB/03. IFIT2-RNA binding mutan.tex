\subsubsection{Summary}
We have described how bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant was designed based on the published human IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant data (needs to be annotated more). Overexpression of bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant yields cellular distribution and morphology similar to what was observed with overexpressing human IFIT2-FLAG, suggesting that the mutant proteins are not toxic to the cells. In the first experiment where we were looking at interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pseudo inclusion bodies we saw several phenotypes. We observed bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant being excluded from small and big pIBs and pIB associated filamentous network, while fully or partially colocalising with other pIBs. In a subsequent experiment we observed only colocalization and inclusion formation. When assessing the interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pIBs formed using wild-type human RSV P and GFP-tagged human RSV N, we observed consistently in two experiments that bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant colocalises to the pIB structures.
