\subsection{IFIT Subcellular Localisation During Interferon Induction and RSV Infection} \label{subsec:IFIT Subcellular Localisation During Interferon Induction and RSV Infection}
introduction for why we wanted to look at colocalisation of ifit durng infection and elsevere

To investigate this, we seeded A549, MDBK, and later BEAS2B cell lines on a 13 mm diameter glass coverslip in a 24-well plate in a initial concentration on 100,000 cells per well as described in Section \ref{sec:Cell Culture}. 24 hours post seeding these cells were either mock infected; treated with either human or bovine interferon alpha at concentrations of 1,000 international units per mL for the former or 5 ng/mL (these concentrations correspond to each other); or infected with either human or bovine wild-type RSV at MOI of 1. After 24 hours the samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and prepared as described in Section \ref{sec:Confocal Microscopy} for the subsequent confocal microscopy analysis. The samples were stained with DAPI that allowed nuclear detection (consistently shown in yellow) and antibodies against RSV N protein (consistently shown in cyan) and the IFIT proteins (consistently shown in magenta). We used one specific antibody against each of IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5, while we used two antibodies that we had access to against IFIT2. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to these antibodies as IFIT2A and IFIT2B antibodies.

Figure \ref{fig:The Changes in Subcellular Localisation of Human IFITs in A549 Cells Subjected to hIFNa or hRSV} shows the subcellular localisation of human IFIT proteins in mock-, hIFN\(\alpha\)-, or human RSV-treated samples observed in A549 cell line. Human IFIT1 is cytoplasmic and nuclearly excluded in a basal state. Interestingly, hIFN\(\alpha\) stimulation does not alter this localisation pattern, neither the abundance of IFIT1 as detected by the intensity of the signal. During infection, IFIT1 stays cytoplasmic and excluded from nucleus with a possible colocalisation with N, on the outside of the IB structure. The intensity of staining is increased, especially in uninfected cells, suggesting hypothesis from Chapter \ref{ch:Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV} is correct. IFIT2A antibody shows hIFIT2 to be located in cytoplasmicly diffused but nuclearly excluded vesicular pattern, for both basal pattern and IFN\(\alpha\) induced pattern. The intensity between these two conditions appear to be equal. During hRSV infection, the overal intensity seems to decrease. The subcellular localisation also changes into a phenotype with less vesicules and inclusions inside the RSV IB structures. IFIT2B antibody on the other hand detects IFIT2 to be granular and cytoplasmic, while also showing to be excluded from the nucleus. Like with IFIT2A antibody, the intensity and localisation phenotype between mock and IFN\(\alpha\) treated cells is equal. During hRSV onfection, this antibody detect IFIT2 to be excluded from both the nucleus and the inclusion body, while retaining vesicular cytoplasmic stain. IFIT3 appears to be cytoplasmic with nuclear exclusion under basal conditions. After IFN\(\alpha\) treatment we can observe increase in the staining intensity and signs of IFIT3 nuclear translocation. During hRV infection IFIT3 seems to be evenly diffused throught the whole cell, including the RSV inclusion body and the nucleus. The intesity of staining during infection appears similar between IFN\(\alpha\) treated and hRSV infected cells. IFIT5 is also cytoplasmically located under basal conditions while being excluded rom the nucleus. During IFN\(\alpha\) treatment the phenotype and the intensity of the staining remain the same. Dyring hRSV infection, we can see uninfected cells dyspaing increased IFIT5 levels. With regards to the staining pattern, it remains cytoplasmic and excluded from both nucleus and RSV IB.

Figure \ref{fig:The Changes in Subcellular Localisation of Bovine IFITs in MDBK Cells Subjected to bIFNa or bRSV} shows the subcellular localisation of bovine IFIT proteins in mock-, bIFN\(\alpha\)-, or bovine RSV-treated samples observed in MDBK cell line.

Under basal conditions, bIFIT1 is located cytoplasmicly with nuclear exclusion. In some cells we can see vesicules located throught the cells. Upon bIFN\(\alpha\) stimulation we can see that the subcellular localisation remains unchanged. What changes is the overall intensity of staining. Samples infected with bRSV show cytoplasmic staining with nuclear and IB exclusion, without any ovious vesicules. Surrounding non infected cells dysplay increased IFIT1 signal, while infected cells show staioning intensity lower than what we observed with interferon stimulated cells. IFIT2A antibody detects bIFIT2 to be predonimantly cytoplasmic with concentrations in a proximity to nucleus which resemble the endoplasmic reticulum. This signal is also excluded from the nucleus. In interferon treaded cells, the overal pattern apperas to be the same with the expetion of decreased staining intensity and decreased size of nucleraly proximal condensations. During bRSV infection we see results identical to wat was observed in A549 cell line. The cytoplasmic signal is greatly reduced and instead IFIT2 either colocalises with RSV N on the baundry of the IB, or concentrates inside the inclusion bodies as a inclusion. IFIT2B on the other hand shows bIFIT2 to be cytoplamic with vesicules present spread through the cytoplasm and nucleus under basal conditions. Unfortunately we lack the cells treated with bIFN\(\alpha\) that were stained with IFIT2B antibody. During bRSV infection, this antibldy shows bIFIT2 to have the same localisation and intensity as what was observed in mock cells. It also shows IFIT2 to be excluded from the IB structure. bIFIT3 appears to be localised in vesicules with cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation in both mock and bIFN\(\alpha\) treated cells. The intensity signal appears to be slightly stronger in the interferon treated samples. During bRSV infection IFIT3 subcellular localisation changes drasticaly. It is barely detectable in cytoplasm and nucleus with the expeption of strong intra inclusion body inclusions. There also appears to be vesicles inside the inclusion that resembles the IBAGs. Last but not least, bIFIT5 shows cytoplasmic localisation with vesicles diffused through the cytoplasm, weak nuclear staining and inclusion within nuclei, most probaly colocalising with the nucleololi. In the samples treated with bIFN\(\alpha\), we cna see that although the pattern of subcellular localisation stays the same, the intensity is increased, especially in the nucleus. Finally, in the cells infected with the bRSV, we can observe nuclear exclusion with inclusion within the nucleoi; cytoplasmic staining with no obvious either colocalisation nor exclusion with RSV IBs. We can also see the cytoplasmic vesicles observed previously, although only in non-infected cells. The intensity of the staining resembles the one of mock treated cells.

Puting both results together and linking it to the massive analysis ...

Seeing the potentially intersting results with IFIT colocalisation with RSV IBs, we systematically analysed 1727 IB sizes and their underlying interaction phenotype with the different IFIT proteins. We categorised the phenotypes solely based on the IFIT staining, but in the area of the image where a presence of inclusion body was confirmed by viral protein staining. Based on our observations, we decided to categorise the phenotypes in a following manner: \textbf{Diffusion} phenotype would be assigned if the IFIT signal would be equally spread through the area if interest; \textbf{Exclusion} phenotype, which would be assigned by a obvious, partial or full, decrease in signal within the boundry of IB; \textbf{Edge exclusion} phenotype would be assigned if the IFIT signal would be equally spread through the area if interest with the exeption of IB boundry, from which it would be excluded; \textbf{Inclusion} phenotype would be assignes if there was obvious increase in the IFIT signal within the boundry of IB; and \textbf{Colocalisation} phenotype, which would be assigned if the IFIT signal would be equally spread through the area if interest with the exeption of increased signal in the IB boundry. These main phenotypes were also simetimes supplemented by either their interaction, or the presence of spots within the IB boundry. For the former, a very common occurance was colocalisation accompanied by exclusion. This was when there was an obvious increase on the IB boundry compared to the surrounding signal, while also a marked decrease of signal from within the region of interest was present. For the latter, these spots were termed IBAGs, as we speculate that these structures could be inclusion body associated granules.

about setting gains menaing two images dont have the same intensities but signal is real. extending the useful range etc..  we cared about the observed phenotype. bilinear interpretation etc ... put the Figure \ref{fig:Inclusion Bodies Within RSV Infected Cells: Zoom Sequence} as an example of analysis and final images ...
