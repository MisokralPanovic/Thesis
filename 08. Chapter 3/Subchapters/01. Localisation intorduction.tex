Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI and are shown in yellow; RSV inclusion bodies are shown in cyan; and the cytoplasm is shown in magenta. Figure highlights a zoom sequence from a population of cells, into a single syncytia view, with lastly focusing at one individual inclusion body.}

ibs are mainly spherical although expeptions happpen

    \caption[Size Characterization of Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines.]{\textbf{Size Characterization of Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines.} This figure presents the relationship between the measured area (\(\mu m^2\)) and diameter (\(\mu m\)) of individual inclusion bodies (IBs) as observed within the scope of this study. Additionally, the figure includes distinct population distributions depicted alongside the plots, representing (a) the aggregate of 1727 observations of IBs across all individual cell lines, (b) 1008 observations from the A549 cell line, (c) 99 observations from the BEAS2B cell line, and (d) 620 observations from the MDBK cell line. Contour plots are incorporated to elucidate the underlying density of individual IBs within the plots.}

there is a clear difference in sizes detected in our study
compare to published and fj thesis
mdbk has more small ibs
each cell line seems to have also unusally large ibs

Cells were fixed, and stained with DAPI (nuclei detection; yellow), anti-RSV N antibody (cyan), or with antibodies against IFIT proteins (magenta). Two antibodies against IFIT2 were used, termed IFIT2A and IFIT2B. Insets with magnified selections were created from infected images to more easily convey the underlying subcellular localisations.}
