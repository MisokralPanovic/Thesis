\chapter{Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} \label{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter3}
Intro about RSV IB, its components, function and known siphoning about increasing size increasing maturity


Add intro about what we think it's happening with IBs and pIBs
Using pIBs as simpler model (only N+P+ cellular components) -> h/bRSV infections -> overexpression during infection

First aim: look at how does cellular and subcellular localisation changes in response to infection, which could suggest ivolvement of IFITs with RSV lifecycle
Second aim: detaily asses the interaction of IFITs and RSV IBs during infection, with a foollow up experiments on a simplified system of pIBs, along with overexpression during infection, to further assess these

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter3}
COMPARE AND CONTRAST ALL IFIT5 IN ALL 3 CELL LINES

HYPOTHETISE ABOUT INTERACTION BETWEEN IFITS AND IB maturity

SAY ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS WITH pIB AS A SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM THAT COULD ANDWER THE DIVERSITY QUESTION
