\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter3}
As elucidated in the preceding chapters, human \textit{IFIT} genes exhibit induction in response to both human and bovine RSV infections, suggesting their potential contribution to an anti-RSV role \textit{in vivo}. In contrast, the responsiveness of bovine \textit{IFITs} to human and bovine RSV infections appears limited, possibly influenced by baseline expression levels of these genes. Notably, Drori et al. reported that ectopically expressed human IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 hindered the growth of hRSV, though the precise mechanism of action remains elusive \cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}. IFIT proteins, known for their diverse antiviral functions, engage in various mechanisms, differing among the IFIT proteins. These mechanisms include direct interactions of IFIT1 and IFIT5 with 5'-RNA modifications \cite{Abbas2013StructuralProteins, Diamond2014IFIT1:Translation}, IFIT2's pro-apoptotic action mediated through direct interactions with mitochondrial membranes \cite{Chen2017InhibitionApoptosis}, and IFIT3-mediated potentiation of RIG-I signaling via scaffold formation between MAVS and TBK1 on mitochondrial membranes \cite{Liu2011IFN-InducedTBK1}. Additionally, IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 form heterodimer and heterotrimer protein complexes, enhancing IFIT stability and potentially influencing their functions \cite{Mears2018BetterResponse}. Examining the subcellular localization of IFIT proteins in infected cells may serve as a proxy for understanding their mechanism of RSV inhibition. We propose that the sites of IFIT/RSV interactions are the RSV inclusion bodies, which form early in the infection cycle (6 HPI). These membraneless viral organelles, created by liquid-liquid phase separation, contain essential components of the RSV viral polymerase complex and serve as functional sites for RSV RNA transcription and replication \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Weber1995NonstructuralSerum, Fricke2013P38Assembly, Jobe2021BovineResponses}. IBs house the RNA genome and polyadenylated RNA, with the latter spatially segregated into substructures called IBAGs (IB-associated granules), while the genome is distributed throughout the IB structure but excluded from IBAGs \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus}. RSV IBs increase in size and complexity as they mature, with only larger, more mature IBs containing IBAGs \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2021BovineResponses}. IBAGs further contain the M2/1 protein, along with the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4G, eIF4F, eIF3A, eIF4H, eIF4A, eIF4A1, and eIF4B \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. Given the reported interactions of IFIT1 and IFIT2 with eIF3E and eIF3C, hindering 43S-mRNA complex formation \cite{Diamond2014IFIT1:Translation, Guo2000CharacterizationVirus}, further indicating that the mechanism of action of these proteins against RSV could be mediated via IB interaction. Moreover, the maturation process of RSV IBs, characterized by increased size and complexity, with larger, mature IBs containing IBAGs, further underscores the potential significance of IFIT/IB interactions \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2021BovineResponses}. Our objective was to delineate the specific functions of IFIT proteins contributing to the reduction in RSV fitness. To achieve this, we initiated an assessment and comparison of the subcellular localization of human and bovine IFIT proteins under various conditions, including mock infection, treatment with human/bovine IFN\(\alpha\), and human/bovine RSV infection. Subsequently, we undertook a thorough analysis of human and bovine IFIT proteins, focusing on their interactions with the corresponding RSV IBs across multiple cell lines. These observations were made using confocal microscopy, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic interactions between IFIT proteins and RSV IBs.
