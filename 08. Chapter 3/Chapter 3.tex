\chapter{Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} \label{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter3}
As established in the previous chapters, human \textit{IFIT} genes are induced following human and bovine RSV infections and thus have the propensity to enforce their anti-RSV role \textit{in vivo}. On the other hand, bovine \textit{IFITs} responses to human and bovine RSV infections were limited, however this could be due to potential higher basal expression of these genes. Drori et al. reported ectopicaly expressed human IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 to inhibit the growth of hRSV, however the mechanism of action remains to be elucitated \cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}. IFIT proteins have been reported to enact their antiviral functions via multitude of mechanisms, which range between the different IFIT proteins. These range from direct interactions of IFIT1 and IFIT5 with 5'-RNA modifications \cite{Abbas2013StructuralProteins, Diamond2014IFIT1:Translation}, IFIT2 pro-apoptotic action, which is mediated via direct interactions with mitochondrial membranes \cite{Chen2017InhibitionApoptosis}, and IFIT3 mediated RIG-I signalling poentiation through the formation a scaffold between MAVS and TBK1 on mitochondrial membranes \cite{Liu2011IFN-InducedTBK1}. IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 have also been observed to form heterodimer and heterotrimer protein complexes, which increase the IFIT stability and can influence the functions of these proteins \cite{Mears2018BetterResponse}. Assesing the subcellular localisation of IFIT protiens in infected cells could therefore act as a proxy for their RSV inhibitory mechanism of action. We hypothetise that the sites of IFIT/RSV interactions are the RSV inclusion bodies. These structures form early in the infection cycle (6 HPI) and are fluid membraneless viral organelles that are formed by LLPS \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus}. They contain all components of the RSV viral polymerase complex (N, P, L, and M2/1 proteins) and have been described as functional sites of RSV RNA transcription and replication \cite{Weber1995NonstructuralSerum, Fricke2013P38Assembly, Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2021BovineResponses}. IBs are the sites of RNA genome and polyadenylated RNA accumulation, althouth these are spacialy differentiated, with the polyadenylated RNA being present in specific substrucutres with diferential electron density called IBAGs, while the genome is present throught the IB structure but excluded from IBAGs \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus}. These substructures further contain the M2/1 protein, along with the translation initiation factors eIF4G, eIF4F, eIF3A, eIF4H, eIF4A, eIF4A1, and eIF4B \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. IFIT1 and IFIT2 have been reported to block 43S-mRNA complex complex formation by by interacting with eIF3E and eIF3C \cite{Diamond2014IFIT1:Translation, Guo2000CharacterizationVirus}, further indicating that the mechanism of action of these proteins against RSV could be mediated via IB interaction. RSV IBs increase in size and complexity as they mature, with only larger, more mature IBs containing IBAGs \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2021BovineResponses}. ... more about maturity and size ...



First aim: look at how does cellular and subcellular localisation changes in response to infection, which could suggest ivolvement of IFITs with RSV lifecycle
Second aim: detaily asses the interaction of IFITs and RSV IBs during infection
