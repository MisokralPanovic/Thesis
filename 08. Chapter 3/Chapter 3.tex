\chapter{Detailed Analysis of Subcellular Localisation of Human and Bovine IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}

\section{Introduction and Aims}
Add intro about what we think it’s happening with IBs and pIBs \newline
Using pIBs as simpler model (only N+P+ cellular components) -> h/bRSV infections -> overexpression during infection

\subsection{Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation} \label{Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation}
Add stuff about the likelihood of IFIT and viral proteins and their propensity to phase separate \newline
This is using an online tool called PSPredictor


\section{Discussion}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that’s why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.
