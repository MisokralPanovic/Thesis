\chapter{Subcellular Localisation of IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} \label{ch:Subcellular Localisation of IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}

\section{Introduction and Aims} \label{sec:Introduction and Aims-Chapter3}
Add intro about what we think it's happening with IBs and pIBs
Using pIBs as simpler model (only N+P+ cellular components) -> h/bRSV infections -> overexpression during infection

First aim: look at how does cellular and subcellular localisation changes in response to infection, which could suggest ivolvement of IFITs with RSV lifecycle
Second aim: detaily asses the interaction of IFITs and RSV IBs during infection, with a foollow up experiments on a simplified system of pIBs, along with overexpression during infection, to further assess these

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:Discussion-Chapter3}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that's why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.
