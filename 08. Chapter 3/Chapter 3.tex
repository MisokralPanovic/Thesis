\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter3}









As established in the previous chapters, human \textit{IFIT} genes are induced following human and bovine RSV infections and thus have the propensity to enforce their anti-RSV role \textit{in vivo}. On the other hand, bovine \textit{IFITs} responses to human and bovine RSV infections were limited, however this could be due to potential higher basal expression of these genes. Drori et al. reported ectopicaly expressed human IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 to inhibit the growth of hRSV, however the mechanism of action remains to be elucitated \cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}. IFIT proteins have been reported to enact their antiviral functions via multitude of mechanisms, which range between the different IFIT proteins. These range from direct interactions of IFIT1 and IFIT5 with 5'-RNA modifications \cite{Abbas2013StructuralProteins, Diamond2014IFIT1:Translation}, IFIT2 pro-apoptotic action, which is mediated via direct interactions with mitochondrial membranes \cite{Chen2017InhibitionApoptosis}, and IFIT3 mediated RIG-I signalling poentiation through the formation a scaffold between MAVS and TBK1 on mitochondrial membranes \cite{Liu2011IFN-InducedTBK1}. IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 have also been observed to form heterodimer and heterotrimer protein complexes, which increase the IFIT stability and can influence the functions of these proteins \cite{Mears2018BetterResponse}. Assesing the subcellular localisation of IFIT protiens in infected cells could therefore act as a proxy for their RSV inhibitory mechanism of action. We hypothetise that the sites of IFIT/RSV interactions are the RSV inclusion bodies. These structures ...




We hypothetise ... first look at localisation to gauge potential mechanisms of interactions ... the inhibition could be IB mediated ... what are ibs ... 




Intro about RSV IB, its components, function and known siphoning about increasing size increasing maturity





First aim: look at how does cellular and subcellular localisation changes in response to infection, which could suggest ivolvement of IFITs with RSV lifecycle
Second aim: detaily asses the interaction of IFITs and RSV IBs during infection
