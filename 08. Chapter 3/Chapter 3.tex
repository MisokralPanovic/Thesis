\chapter{Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} \label{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Nascent IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter3}
Intro about RSV IB, its components, function and known siphoning about increasing size increasing maturity


Add intro about what we think it's happening with IBs and pIBs


First aim: look at how does cellular and subcellular localisation changes in response to infection, which could suggest ivolvement of IFITs with RSV lifecycle
Second aim: detaily asses the interaction of IFITs and RSV IBs during infection

CHANGE SOME "MEDIAN VALUES" FOR "TYPICAL SIZES"

\section{Results} \label{sec:Results-Chapter3}

\input{08. Chapter 3/Subchapters/02. Infection.tex}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter3}
COMPARE AND CONTRAST ALL IFIT IN ALL 3 CELL LINES

HYPOTHETISE ABOUT INTERACTION BETWEEN IFITS AND IB maturity

TALK SOMEWHERE ABOUT FALSE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES AND LIMITED Z STACK 
ALTHOUGH CONSISTEND DATA BETWEEN CELL LINES AND SO

TALK ABOUT PUBLISHED DATA ON IFIT AND RSV LOCALISATION


SAY ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS WITH pIB AS A SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM THAT COULD ANDWER THE DIVERSITY QUESTION
