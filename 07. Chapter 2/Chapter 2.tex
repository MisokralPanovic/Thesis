\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims Chapter2}
From published literature, it is evident that induced human \textit{IFIT} expression negatively impacts RSV replication. The results obtained in Chapter \ref{ch:Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV} confirm differential expression of human \textit{IFITs} in response to both hRSV and bRSV infections. However, an investigation into \textit{in vitro} bovine \textit{IFIT} induction and its potential influence on bovine RSV has not been undertaken to date.

Our hypothesis posited that bovine \textit{IFITs} would be induced by both human and bovine RSV, similar to the observations made for human \textit{IFITs} in the previous chapter. Our objective was to systematically test this hypothesis, employing methodologies akin to those used in Chapter \ref{ch:Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV}. Initially, our efforts were directed towards preparing essential technological materials and information, such as qPCR primers for \textit{bIFIT} detection. Presently, no commercially available primers exist for this purpose. Additionally, we aimed to assess bRSV growth in various model bovine cell lines employed in our study. Subsequently, we sought to confirm the capability of our model cell lines to induce \textit{IFITs} following the treatment with known activators of the innate immune system, such as IFN\(\alpha\) and LPS. Following this, our strategy involved evaluating \textit{IFIT} induction during both human and bovine RSV infections, utilizing a range of viral concentrations and various end assay time points.

\subsubsection{Primer Design and Validation for Bovine \textit{IFIT} Quantification} \label{Primer Design and Validation for Bovine IFIT Quantification}
Due to the initial lack of commercially available primers for the detection of bovine \textit{IFIT} transcripts at the outset of the project, we devised a panel comprising three primer sets (PS) for each bovine \textit{IFIT} gene. Detailed information about this process is outlined in Section \ref{subsec:Primer Design and Assay Setup}. Briefly, we inputted the coding sequences into the PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies) to identify the most suitable oligonucleotides. To evaluate the amplification efficiencies of each primer set, we employed serial dilutions of \textit{IFIT} DNA clones from a bovine ISG library as standards (accessible through a collaboration with CVR Glasgow). The outcomes are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Validation of custom-made bIFIT qPCR primers}. The graph demonstrates that primer sets 1 exhibited the most favourable amplification efficiencies. All primer sets, except for \textit{bIFIT3}, yielded amplification efficiencies of around 100\%. Consequently, they were chosen for subsequent experiments. While \textit{bIFIT3} primer sets demonstrated similar outcomes in terms of standard curve slopes and amplification efficiencies, PS1 consistently outperformed the others in repeated testing rounds (data not presented). As a result, it was selected for further experimentation.

The PSs behaviour was monitored throughout the project, as fresh standard curves were created per experiment. Figure \ref{fig:The Performance of Custom Made Primer Sets Over Time} shows that the average data is consistent with what was observed in initial testing (Figure \ref{fig:Validation of custom-made bIFIT qPCR primers}), however, there were per experiment deviations in slope angles for each of the selected primer pairs. The underlying amplification efficiencies stayed consistent, as is highlighted by the averaged efficiencies displayed. The initial \textit{bIFIT3} PSs differential amplification slopes were different compared to the other \textit{bIFIT} PSs, as well as the variable nature of PSs performance throughout the project. This prohibited the usage of \(\Delta\)\(\Delta\)Ct methodologies for transcript quantification as the increase in cycle threshold would not be proportional to the decrease of transcript abundance between the \textit{bIFITs}, and thus a different methodology had to be adopted. This is described in detail in Section \ref{subsec:Data Processing}. In short, the copy numbers were deducted from standard curves and factorised by the relative abundance of bovine \textit{GAPDH}. This ensured the slope-independent establishment of relative expression values, mirroring and complementing data from \(\Delta\)\(\Delta\)Ct methodologies.

\subsubsection{Growth Curves of Bovine RSV in Bovine Cell Lines} \label{Growth Curves of Bovine RSV in Bovine Cell Lines}
Although my colleagues in the Viral Glycoproteins Group from the Pirbright Institute routinely perform hRSV infections of the MDBK cell line, data in the BT cell line is currently lacking. Therefore we set up bRSV growth curves in both cell lines side by side to investigate which time points would be relevant for further infection experiments. Crude-extracted bRSV, isolated as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Propagation and Production} and quantified as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Quantification by TCID50 Assay} was used for the establishment of growth curves as described in Section \ref{subsec:Viral Growth Curves}. In brief, the MDBK and the BT cell line were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with WT bRSV at MOI 0.1. The supernatant and cellular fractions were collected at time intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours post-infection, snap frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and later tittered as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Quantification by TCID50 Assay}. As can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:bRSV growth curves in MDBK and BT cell lines}, there is a differential infection profile between the cell lines. bRSV growth in the MDBK cell line was initially exponential, starting at \(10^{2.5}\) viral titre solely detected in the cytosolic fraction at 24 HPI, it increased to \(10^{4}\) and \(10^{3}\) for the cellular and supernatant fractions respectively at 48 hours. At 72 hours, the cellular viral titre reached \(10^{4.5}\), while the supernatant one further increased to \(10^{3.5}\). Afterwards, the cellular titre remained stable until 120 hours, after which it declined by more than an order of magnitude to \(10^{3}\) at 144 hours and then further increased again to \(10^{3.5}\) at 168 hours. The supernatant titre increased to \(10^{4.5}\) and \(10^{5.5}\) at 120 and 144 hours respectively, and afterwards it decreased to \(10^{4.5}\) again at 168 hours. The peak combined titre occurred at 144 hours but it was robust from 48 hours onwards. bRSV growth in BT cell line displayed virtually no titre from supernatant fraction at 24 and 48 hours. Regardless, the 24-hour time point was the peak value of the combined, as well as cellular titre with cellular titres of \(10^{4}\) at 24 hours and \(10^{3}\) at 48 hours. Cellular titres further declined to \(10^{2}\) at 72 hours, and since then they remained stable other than a small increase to \(10^{2.5}\) at 120 HPI. On the other hand, supernatant titre peaked at 72 hours at \(10^{4}\), slightly decreased to \(10^{3.5}\) at 120 hours and afterwards stayed stable until the end of the experiment. From this experiment, we can conclude that the viral replication kinetics differ substantially between the two cell lines and the data suggests that we can be certain of viral replication at 48 HPI in MDBK cell line and 24 HPI in the BT cell line.

These were subsequently quantified by TCID50 methodology. The total viral titre is shown in the middle panel.}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions Chapter2}
We confirmed the responsiveness of both MDBK and BT cell lines to bovine IFN$\alpha$, demonstrating competence in inducing \textit{bIFIT} and \textit{bMx1}. Similar to the observation with \textit{hIFITs}, where LPS barely induced \textit{hIFITs} to biologically significant levels, LPS failed to induce \textit{bIFITs} in the MDBK cell line. Extensive experimentation revealed either no or only minimal induction of bovine \textit{IFITs} by bRSV infection. Our data suggests that WT bRSV does not influence \textit{bIFIT} induction, whereas ultrapurified WT bRSV induces \textit{bMx1} expression. This discrepancy might be attributed to cellular contaminants present in crudely extracted WT bRSV, hindering the induction of this gene. In the MDBK cell line, we observed specific inhibition of \textit{bIFIT2} induction by SH and NS1 bRSV proteins. Infection with mutant bRSV lacking these proteins resulted in a mild but biologically significant induction. Conversely, NS2 protein appears to inhibit the induction of \textit{bIFIT1}, \textit{bIFIT2}, and \textit{bIFIT3}, with both NS1 and NS2 potentially acting synergistically. In the BT cell line, while WT bRSV failed to induce \textit{bIFITs}, $\Delta$SH bRSV caused a biologically significant downregulation of \textit{bIFIT} mRNA levels, presenting a puzzling phenotype. Collectively, it appears that there are elements within bRSV inhibiting the induction of \textit{bIFITs} and \textit{bMx1}.

Furthermore, we aimed to explore if the observed host restriction of RSV \textit{in vivo} could be attributed to induced \textit{bIFIT} expression, akin to what was observed with \textit{hIFITs} (Section \ref{subsec:Human IFITs Responses to bRSV}). The investigation also aimed to determine whether the inability to induce \textit{bIFITs} by bRSV is specific to that virus. Notably, we observed no biologically significant induction of \textit{bIFITs} in either the MDBK or BT cell lines. Additionally, we noted that the purification procedure substantially influenced the differential expression of \textit{bIFITs} and exhibited notable differences between the two cell lines. For instance, although ultrapurified hRSV did not affect \textit{bIFIT} levels in the MDBK cell line, crude extracted hRSV marginally induced \textit{bIFIT1}, \textit{bIFIT2}, and \textit{bIFIT3}, while significantly inhibiting \textit{bIFIT5} induction. Conversely, crudely extracted hRSV did not influence \textit{bIFIT} expression in the BT cell line, whereas infection with ultrapurified hRSV biologically significantly downregulated all \textit{bIFITs}. Taken together, these findings suggest that either \textit{bIFITs} might not be involved in human and bovine RSV infection, or the chosen cell lines for the experiments might not accurately represent the \textit{in vivo} scenario. In addressing these queries, we referred to the literature and found two related RNAseq experiments exploring the differentially expressed genes from bronchial lymph nodes or whole blood of dairy calves. These studies identified all bovine \textit{IFITs} as differentially expressed in the former, while \textit{bIFIT2} and \textit{bIFIT5} transcripts were detected as differentially expressed in whole blood \cite{Johnston2019ExperimentalResponse., Johnston2021MessengerCalves}. Collectively, it appears that all bovine \textit{IFITs} are induced \textit{in vivo}, indicating their potential involvement in bRSV replication restriction, similar to what is observed with human \textit{IFITs}. The crucial question remains: what is the causal factor leading to the reduction in RSV viral fitness?
