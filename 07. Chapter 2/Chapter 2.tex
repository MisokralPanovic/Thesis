\textbf{Half page aims:}
We hypothesised  bovine IFITs to be induced by human and bovine RSV infection. We aimed to systematically test this by initially confirming that our model cell lines are capable of IFIT induction following the treatment of known innate immune system activators such as interferon alpha, and LPS. We would then assess the IFIT induction during human and bovine RSV infection using a range of viral concentration and end assay time points. Lastly, we would validate this data in more physiologically relevant cell lines as well as using omics approaches.

\subsection{Technology Establishment} \label{subsec:Technology Establishment}
\subsubsection{Primer Design and Validation for Bovine \textit{IFIT} Quantification} \label{Primer Design and Validation for Bovine IFIT Quantification}
Due to the initial lack of commercially available primers for the detection of bovine \textit{IFIT} transcripts at the outset of the project, I devised a panel comprising three primer sets (PS) for each bovine \textit{IFIT} gene. Detailed information about this process is outlined in Section \ref{subsec:Primer Design and Assay Setup}. In a nutshell, I inputted the coding sequences into the PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies) to identify the most suitable oligonucleotides. To evaluate the amplification efficiencies of each primer set, I employed \textit{IFIT} DNA clones from a bovine ISG library as standards (accessible through a collaboration with CVR Glasgow). The outcomes are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Validation of custom-made bIFIT qPCR primers}. The graph demonstrates that primer sets 1 exhibited the most favourable amplification efficiencies. All primer sets, except for \textit{bIFIT3}, yielded nearly impeccable amplification efficiencies of around 100\%. Consequently, they were chosen for subsequent experiments. While \textit{bIFIT3} primer sets demonstrated similar outcomes in terms of standard curve slopes and amplification efficiencies, PS1 consistently outperformed the others in repeated testing rounds (data not presented). As a result, it was singled out for further experimentation.

The resulting standard curves are shown here. Primer set (PS) 1 (a), 2 (b), and 3 (c) are depicted for bovine \textit{IFIT1} (1.), \textit{IFIT2} (2.), \textit{IFIT3} (3.), and \textit{IFIT5} (4.), along with their calculated amplification efficiencies.}

\end{figure}

The PSs behaviour was monitored throughout the project, as fresh standard curves were created per experiment. Figure \ref{fig:The Performance of Custom Made Primer Sets Over Time} shows that the average data is consistent with what was observed in initial testing (Figure \ref{fig:Validation of custom-made bIFIT qPCR primers}), however, there were per experiment deviations in slope angles for each of the selected primer pairs. The underlying amplification efficiencies stayed consistent, as is highlighted by the averaged efficiencies displayed. The initial \textit{bIFIT3} PSs differential amplification slopes compared to the other \textit{bIFIT} PSs, as well as the variable nature of PSs performance throughout the project prohibits the usage of \(\Delta\)\(\Delta\)Ct methodologies for transcript quantification as the increase in cycle threshold would not be proportional to the decrease of transcript abundance between the \textit{bIFITs}, and thus a different methodology had to be adopted. This is described in detail in Section \ref{subsec:Data Processing}. In short, the copy numbers were deducted from standard curves and factorised by the relative abundance of bovine \textit{GAPDH}. This ensured the slope-independent establishment of relative expression values, mirroring and complementing data from \(\Delta\)\(\Delta\)Ct methodologies.

\subsubsection{Growth Curves of Bovine RSV in Bovine Cell Lines} \label{Growth Curves of Bovine RSV in Bovine Cell Lines}
Although my colleagues in the Viral Glycoproteins Group from the Pirbright Institute routinely perform hRSV infections of the MDBK cell line, the data in the BT cell line is currently lacking. Therefore I set up bRSV growth curves in both cell lines side by side to investigate which time points would be relevant for further infection experiments. Crude-extracted bRSV, isolated as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Propagation and Production} and quantified as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Quantification by TCID50 Assay} was used for the establishment of growth curves as described in Section \ref{subsec:Viral Growth Curves}. In brief, the MDBK and the BT cell line were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with WT bRSV at MOI 0.1. The supernatant and cellular fractions were collected at time intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours post-infection, snap frozen in dry ice ethanol mixture, and later tittered as described in Section \ref{subsec:Virus Quantification by TCID50 Assay}. As can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:bRSV growth curves in MDBK and BT cell lines}, there is a differential infection profile between the cell lines. bRSV growth in the MDBK cell line was initially exponential, starting at \(10^{2.5}\) viral titre solely detected in the cytosolic fraction at 24 HPI, it increased to \(10^{4}\) and \(10^{3}\) for the cellular and supernatant fractions respectively at 48 hours. At 72 hours, the cellular viral titre reached \(10^{4.5}\), while the supernatant one further increased to \(10^{3.5}\). Afterwards, the cellular titre remained stable until 120 hours, after which it declined by more than an order of magnitude to \(10^{3}\) at 144 hours and then further increased again to \(10^{3.5}\) at 168 hours. The supernatant titre increased to \(10^{4.5}\) and \(10^{5.5}\) at 120 and 144 hours respectively, and afterwards it decreased to \(10^{4.5}\) again at 168 hours. The peak combined titre occurred at 144 hours but it was robust from 48 hours onwards. bRSV growth in BT cell line displayed virtually no titre from supernatant fraction at 24 and 48 hours. Regardless, the 24-hour time point was the peak value of the combined, as well as cellular titre with cellular titres of \(10^{4}\) at 24 hours and \(10^{3}\) at 48 hours. Cellular titres further declined to \(10^{2}\) at 72 hours, and since then they remained stable other than a small increase to \(10^{2.5}\) at 120 HPI. On the other hand, supernatant titre peaked at 72 hours at \(10^{4}\), slightly decreased to \(10^{3.5}\) at 120 hours and afterwards stayed stable until the end of the experiment. From this experiment, we can conclude that the viral replication kinetics differ substantially between the two cell lines and the data suggests that we can be certain of viral replication at 48 HPI in MDBK cell line and 24 HPI in the BT cell line.

These were subsequently quantified by TCID50 methodology. The total viral titre is shown in the middle panel.}
