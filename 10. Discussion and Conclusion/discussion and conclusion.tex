\section{Discussion}

qpcr data suggest ifits are activated the most in non infected cells dusing infection ... it seems that they interact with IBs ... is the OE and KO results from the paper because of protection prior to infection or because of intreactions with IBs? ... conclude that probs both


lets assume i3 is non reeactive with (p)IBs (or minimaly reactvie) - baseline to what is ifit based interaction

compare the observed phenotypes in a range of IB sizes (small, mid, large) and what interaction with differet ifits are there

do human ifits qpcr + connfocal
do bovine ifits  + confocal
compare the two


\section{Final Remarks and Future Directions}
experiments that we wanted to do but they did not work or we did not have time to do them


about stable and inducible cell lines and our try to make them but failing
ifit inducible cell lines
ifit sh cell lines+

minigenome

stain for inert proteins or gfp/rfp and see if they associate with ib and pibs

measure ibs from non transfected cells (INFECTION TRANSFECTION)


pibs + i2 + i3

IFITI IP and Mass spec
\cite{Oliveira2013HumanCells} - IP of n p and m2/1 doesnt show ifits as interactors

transfecting bi2f24 + bngfp + p inhibits bpIBs (compared to hi2f or bi2f)
