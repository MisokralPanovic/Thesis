\subsection{IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation with Regards to RSV Pseudo-IBs} \label{subsec:IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation with Regards to RSV Pseudo-IBs}


To investigate the intreaction of IFITs with RSV pseudo inclusion bodies ...

The cells, regardless of the cell line used were cultured and passaged using the standard conditions and procedures, as decribed in Sections \ref{sec:Cell Culture} and \ref{subsec:Passaging and Seeding Cells}. Human or bovine RSV N or P codon optimised ORFs, which were situated in pcDNA3.1 plasmid backbones, were transfected into the cells using TransIT-X2 in 1:2 ratio, as decribed in Section \ref{subsec:Transfecting Cells}. We have tried transfection with lipofectamine 3000 as well, although it was more toxic to cells and provided smilar transfection efficiencies (data not shown). After trying and optimising the transfection conditions in terms of total DNA used, seeding density and different ratios of RSV N and P containing plasmids (data not shown), we have ended up consistently transfecting 500 $\mu$g of each plasmid per 50k cells seeeded in 24 well plate per well.

The initial experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which were very persmisive to plasmid transfection and oftern displaying transfection efficiencies of >90\%. They are not really suitable for confocal microscopy and subsequent image analysis as they have small nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. They are also dfficult to work with as they easily detach from the plastic culture plates during treatment or washes. Regardless, the initial IFIT1 and IFIT2 (Section \ref{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}) staining experiments were conducted using these cells. Due to this we have transitioned into other cell lines. We have tested HeLa and Vero cell lines based on their transfection permisivity, cell morphology, and ease of culture. HeLa was more suitable based on its origin (human uterine epithelial cancer cell line), while the Vero cell line is derived from kidney epithelial tissue of adult African green monkey (\textit{Cercopithecus aethiops}) \cite{Simizu1967CharacterizationVero}. Initial optimasition showed minimal transfection in HeLa cell line in each of the condition tested (data not shown), while the Vero cells were showing constant transfection, albeit with lower transfection efficiencies than what we observed in HEK293T cell line (circa 30\%/90\%, data not shown). Regardless, this was sufficient for confocal microscopy experiments.

Vero cells are ruitinely used to propagate and study a range of viruses, espoecially bRSV. Althogh it would be optimal to be detecting endogenous human IFITs interacting with RSV pseudo-IBs, IFITs of primates are phylogenetically more closely related to human IFITs that bovine IFITs \cite{Zhou2013InterferonDefense.}. Additionaly we have observed in the previous chapter that the interactions of human and bovine IFITs are fairly consistend. Thus assesing the monkey IFIT colocalisation with human or bovine pIBs could yield useful insights into the matter.

    \label{fig:Size Characterisation of Pseudo Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines}
\end{figure}

We systematically observed and annotated a total of 1424 pseudo inclusion bodies across HEK293T (103 observations) and Vero (1321 observations) cell lines. The relationship between their measured area and radia can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Size Characterisation of Pseudo Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines}. pIBs observed in both cell lines broadly follow logaritmic curves, as expected based on the relationship of the observed values, although we can observe a sizable number of detected entities that show larger measured area compared to predicted radius. This indicates elongated ellipsioid shape. The pIBs detected in 293T cell line mainly exhibited the radia of 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the majority of the detected pIBs having their radia between 0.25 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\). With regards to their associated measured area, most of the pIBs were between 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). In the Vero cell line we can observe a higher spread of data as we have observed pIB measuring >5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) in radius and >300 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), however, majoprity of the detrected entities confronted to radia between 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 0.7 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the measured 2D area betweeen 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\).

    \label{fig:The Distributions of pIB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}
\end{figure}

A more detailed view focusong solely on the distribution of measured areas per cell line can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:The Distributions of pIB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}. We can see that pIBs detected in Vero cell line encompas larger range in terms of the minimal and maximal measured area copared to the 293T cell line, however, the median value in the latter was higher. In more detal, in 293T cell line we have measured pIB areas ranging from sub 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 20 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median value of 2.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), while in Vero cell line we have observed pIBs ranging from sub 0.07 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 300 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median value of 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Both median values are considerably smaller to what was observed in cell lines during infection (Section \ref{subsec:IFIT Subcellular Localisation During Interferon Induction and RSV Infection}, Figure \ref{fig:The Distributions of IB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}), which is in line to what was reported in literature where pIBs observed 24 hours post-transfection were considerably smaller than conventional IBs observed in infected cells after equivalent passage of time cite{Jobe2021BovineResponses}.

We obtained 16 observations of endogenous human IFIT1 and its interaction with hRSV pIBs in 293T cell line. The observed phenotype frequencies, along with the measured pIB sizes can be vewed n Figure \ref{fig:Phenotypic Interactions of Human IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the 293T Cell Line}, with the representative iimagese of these phenotypes shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Phenotypic Interactions of Human IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the 293T Cell Line}. A half of the observations displayed diffusion phenotype. This was predominantly observed in smaller pIBs with a typical size of 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and ranging from 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) in size. The second most prevalent phenotype was exclusion, which occured in 44\% of cases. The pIBs associatred with this phenotype closely clustered at around 2.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), whith two exceptions i.e. one very small pIB (0.22 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)) and one ralitaively large pIB (5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)). Lastly, we have observed one pIB with a measured area of 3.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) which exhibited size exclusion phenotype. Overall these data suggest human IFIT1 not associating with human RSV pIB structures, although this is based on a very limited set of observations.

Next we have evaluated endogenous monkey IFIT1 interactions with pIBs created by transfection of hRSV N and P proteins in Vero cell line. The frequencies of occurances of the interaction phenotypes based on 76 observations, along with the measured pIB areas per phenotype are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The representative images of these phenotypes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. 43\% of the observations show monkey IFIT1 forming intra pIB inclusion. This was followed by a diffusion phenotype, which occured in 38\% of observations. Further, 8\% of the observations showed monkey IFIT1 to be colocalisiong with the edge of the pIB structure while beiing excluded from the main pIB structure. Lastly, colocalisation and exclusion phenotypes both individually occured in 5\% of cases each. With regards to the size profile of hRSV pIBs associated with these phenotypes, inclusion was observed in a wide range of pIB sizes, ranging from sub 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 20 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median size of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The diffusion phenotype was observed in pIBs with a smilar range of measured areas, with an identical median value of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). These two phenotypes differ in the distribution of their values. While the pIB sizes of inclusion phenotype-associated pIBs were evenly distributed between its minimal and maximal values, diffusion-associated pIBs clustered at around 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The colocalisation associated with pIB exclusion phenotype occured in larger pIBs with the typical area of 9 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and was not observed in pIBs which were smaller than 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The colocalisation-phenotype associated hRSV pIBs as well were of larger size, with the median value of 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), and minimal value of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Lastly the exclusion phenotype was was observed to be associated with 4 pIBs which had median 2D area of 1.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Overall, although in this simplified model, the size of the pIB should not directly mean a difference in the underlying pIB complexity. Regardelss we observe size-dependent phenotype association. In smaller, sub 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) pIBs we only observed inclusiohn and diffusiion phenotyeps, which were equally prevelant in these. Larger pIBs had inclusion, diffusion and colocalisation associated with exclusion associated with them.

Lastly we have observed monkey IFIT1 interaction,detected by human IFIT1 antibody, with bovine RSV pIBs, using the transfection of bRSV N and P containing plasmids. These plasmids consistently yielded lower transfection efficiencies and thus posed difficulties in obtaining a large amount of observations. Due to this we have failed to generate enough samples to investigate endogenous monkey IFTIs other than IFIT1 and IFIT2using the A antibody (with the respective results shown and discussed in Section \ref{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}). Regardless, the frequencies of occurances of the interaction phenotypes based on 14 observations, along with the measured pIB areas per phenotype are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Bovine pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The representative images of these phenotypes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Bovine pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. We can observe results reminiscent of what was observed with IFIT2, detected by IFIT2(A) antibody during RSV infectrion. That is we observe only two phenotypes: inclusion within the pIB structures, which occurs at 56\% frequency and colocalisation associated with pIB exclusion, which occurs at 44\% frequency. The former occurs predominantly in smaller pIBs, with the median size of 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and not bigger than 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). On the other hand, the colocalisation phenotype associated with exclusion occurs in pIBs with a typical size of 3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). There is an overlap between the pIB sizes of the two phenotypes, although sub 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) pIBs are always associated with inclusion while supra 10 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) are always associated with colocalisation cojoined with exclusion.

Taking all of the IFIT1-pIB interaction results together it seems like there is a differential propensity for pIB interaction between endogenous human and monkey IFIT1. Saying that, data obtained from HEK293T cell line is limited in quantity and displays a size bias towards pIBs that are less than 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) in size. This does not correspond to the true diversity of pIB sizes observed in this study as the aggregate 293T suggest there is a sizable population of supra 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) pIBs that was detected in this study (Figure \ref{fig:The Distributions of pIB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}). In the Vero cell line transfected with hRSV N and P ORF-containing plasmids, we have observed phenotypes that imply direct interaction (colocalisation and colocalisation asssociated with exclusion) specificaly in larger pIBs. This implies that the limited sample size and diversity in 293T observed hRSV pIBs is not sufficient to provide true picture of IFIT1/pIB interaction. On the other hand, it can be also implicative of hIFIT1 not being recruited to the pIBs. Within the Vero cell line we also ofbserved differential results which dependent on the species of the virus. While we have only observed direct interaction phenotypes of inclusion formation and pIB edge colocalsiation with intra-pIB exclusion with the bRSV pIBs, we observed a more diverse interaction range in Vero cells with hRSV pIBs present in them. These phenotypes, however, all, with the exeption of exclusion phenotype (which occured only in 5\% of observations), implied IFIT1 having access to the pIB structure. It is intrueegin to see the differences between humand and bovine RSV pIB and their interaction with monkey IFIT1. This could suggest that the bovine pIB possibly lack mechanism that would prevent them from being targeted by the moneky IFIT1. Saying that, the bovine RSV pIB dataset lacks inthe depth with regards to the amount of observations, and thus the differences could also be atributed to low frequency of diffusion or exclusion phenotypes. In that case the results from Vero cell lines with either human or bovine RSV pIBs present would be almost identical.

Next we investigated IFIT3 interaction with RSV pseudo incluson bodies. As mentioned above we failed to generate samples concisting either of HEK293T cells transfected with hRSV N and P, or Vero cells transfected with bRSV N and P, which would be also stained for IFIT3. Hence we only present the monkey IFIT3 interaction analysis with hRSV pIBs. The frequencies of observed phenotypes within the 39 observations along with the measured pIB sizes per phenotype which occur with more than 5\% frequency are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT3 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The representative images of phenotypes which occur with at  least 5\% frequency are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT3 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The most prevalent phenotype is diffusn throught the pIB structure, which occured at 41\% of observation. This was closely followed by an exclusion phenotype, which occured at 36\% of observations. We have observed monkey IFIT3 to be forming intra pIB inclusion in 15\% of the cxases. Laslty, 5\% of observations showed colocalisation phenotype, while 3\% of all observations shopwed colocalisation associated with exclusion. With regards of the size profile of the IBs associated with the different phenotyeps which displayed at least 5\% frequency, their median values seem to be quite similar, however they encompass a progressivelymore narrow range of values as the occurance frequency decreases. In more detail the diffusion phenotype median pIB size was 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and it encompasses values from 0.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 30 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The exclusion phenotype-associated median area value was 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), while the range of sizes of the detected pIBs encompassed sub 0.6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 10 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The size values of inclusion-associated pIBs clustered at around 3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and ranged from two observations at 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to one observation at 9 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Lastly, the pIBs associated with the colocalisation phenotype were of 1.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). It seems like predominantly in most cases monkey IFIT3 is not directly seen interacting with the hRSV pIB structures, however in a quater of the cases it seems to be either forming inclusions or being associated with the edge of the pIB strucutre. This data seems to confirm our earlier investigation where IFIT3 exhibited predominantly exclusion and diffusion phenotypes during RSV infection.

Lastly we have investigated the IFIT5 interactions with the simplified system of RSV pseudo inclusion bodies. As mentioned previously we only managed to obtain data from Vero cell line transfected with hRSV N and P containing plasmids and thus we can only investigate the monkey IFIT5 interaction with the human pIBs. Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT5 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line} shows the frequencies of occurances of the observed phenotypes alongside the measured pIB areas per observed phenotype from the 100 observations that were recorded. Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT5 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line} shows the representative images of these pehnotypes. We have observed monkey IFIT5 to exert two hRSV pIB interaction phenotypes i.e. to be forming intra-pIB inclusion or to colocalise with the pIB boundry while being excluded from the pIB structure. The former occured in 62\% of observations, while the latter occured in 38\% of observations. The size of inclusion-associated hRSV pIBs ranged from 0.13 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 10 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with atypiocal value of 1.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). On the other hand the size profile of pIBs associated with colocalisation acompalied by exclusion phenotype ranged from 0.23 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 40 with the median value of 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). There seams to be a differentiation of these pIBs based on size although there is a marked overlap of sizes where both phenotypes occur (between 0.23 and 10 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)). Interestingly, previously we have observed both human and bovine IFIT5 to be minimaly interacting with the RSV IBs, with the most prevalent observed phenotype being exclusion (Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}). We have observed the inclusion phenotype only in 10\% of observations in MDBK cell line and the colocalisation associated with exclusioin phenotype in 5\% of observations in A549 cell line. This suggest that IFIT5 has a propensity to interact with the pseudo inclusion bodies but some factors that are present in RSV IBs during infection are preventing IFIT5 from accessing these structures.

Overall the investigaton of IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 localisation with regards to the simplified model of RSV inclusion bodies using ectopically expressed pseudo-inclusion bodies yielded somewhat interesting results, which can lead us to uncover the nature of thier interactions and the potential factors that are impeeding these intreactions during RSV infection. With regards to endogenous IFIT1, we have observed minimal interaction in human cells (HEK293T) with hRSV pIBs, although this could have been as a result of size bias of the observed pIBs. We base this assumption based on the observed monkey IFIT1 interactions with human RSV pIBs, where the strong interaction phenotypes (inclusion and colocalisation) correlated with increased pIB size, and especially based on the results from monkey IFIT1 interaction with bovine RSV pIBs where we solely observed phenotypes implying interaction. The monkey IFIT1 data supports the observations from Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}, where we have observed both human and bovine IFIT1 show strong interaction phenotypes (incluson or colocalisation) with RSV IBs during infection. However this was not the domiminant phenotype observed, which was exclusion. Clearly IFIT1 has a propensity to directly associate with the pIB, a process which seems to be disrupted during infection. Monkey IFIT3 displayed data consistent to what was observed in RSV infection data i.e. majority of the cases being either indirectly associated with pIBs (diffusion), or being excluded from the structures, while directly associating with these strucutres with small but considerable frequency. This suggest that the IFIT3-IB intreraction is directied via biophysical interactions with the pIB and IB structures. Lastly, monkey IFIT5 showed only strong interaction phenotypes with human pIBs. This is unexpected as during infection neither human nor bovine IFIT5 exhibited minimal direct or indirect interaction phenotypes, with the dominant observed phenotype being exclusion. This discrepancy could be due to the diffrential propensity of monkey IFIT5 for interaction with (p)IBs compared to human and bovine IFIT5, or it could mean that viral  or cellular factors associated with and influencing the RSV IBs during infection prevent IFIT5 from interaction with these structures. ... final conclusion and link to oe experiments

\subsection{Overexpressed IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 During RSV Infection} \label{subsec:Overexpressed IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 During RSV Infection}


about still unclear data so try to overexpress ifits during infection

about cloning the ifit plasmids \ref{subsec:DNA Plasmids}
- human ifits provided by trevors lab with c terminal flag tags
- bovine ifits provided in scrpsy 

\ref{subsec:Common Subcloning Methodologies}
\ref{subsec:PCR for Cloning into pcDNA3.1}


about stuff that did not work
- inf-transf bi1, hi3, bi5

difficulty with infections transfections - biast selections for cells that get transfected after infection

that we tried infection and transfection at the same time, and first transfection then infection (which eliminated transfection, based on control gfp plasmid signal)

since this is 48 HPI infection we expect majority of the IBs to be large in size, especially larget to what was observed during infection

we know that ifits 1 2 3 are anti RSV so overexressing them is further biasing the analysis

this data could also be used to gauge if ifit overexpression affects the IB size

the data presented in the coming figures is 100\% confirmed using z stacks

hIFIT5-FLAG is colocalising with hRSV inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining), while in bRSV infected cell there is a hint of IFIT5 signal concentration at the side of bRSV IB.

This data is by single cells per conditions as transfection did not work well. It is however supported by z stack measurements.

Overexpressed hIFIT1-FLAG in the context of h/bRSV infection colocalises to both human and bovine IB structures.

Overexpressed bIFIT3 behaves equally between hRSV and bRSV infection, that is it sometimes colocalises with the IB structure and sometimes is completely excluded from the structure.

Overexpressed hIFIT5 in hRSV infected cells colocalises with the IBs.
