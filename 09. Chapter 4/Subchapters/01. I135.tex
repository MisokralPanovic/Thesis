\subsection{Monkey IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation in a Simplified System of Pseudo-IBs} \label{subsec:Monkey IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation in a Simplified System of Pseudo-IBs}


To investigate the intreaction of IFITs with RSV pseudo inclusion bodies ...

The cells, regardless of the cell line used were cultured and passaged using the standard conditions and procedures, as decribed in Sections \ref{sec:Cell Culture} and \ref{subsec:Passaging and Seeding Cells}. Human or bovine RSV N or P codon optimised ORFs, which were situated in pcDNA3.1 plasmid backbones, were transfected into the cells using TransIT-X2 in 1:2 ratio, as decribed in Section \ref{subsec:Transfecting Cells}. We have tried transfection with lipofectamine 3000 as well, although it was more toxic to cells and provided smilar transfection efficiencies (data not shown). After trying and optimising the transfection conditions in terms of total DNA used, seeding density and different ratios of RSV N and P containing plasmids (data not shown), we have ended up consistently transfecting 500 $\mu$g of each plasmid per 50k cells seeeded in 24 well plate per well.

The initial experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which were very persmisive to plasmid transfection and oftern displaying transfection efficiencies of >90\%. They are not really suitable for confocal microscopy and subsequent image analysis as they have small nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. They are also dfficult to work with as they easily detach from the plastic culture plates during treatment or washes. Regardless, the initial IFIT1 and IFIT2 (Section \ref{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}) staining experiments were conducted using these cells. Due to this we have transitioned into other cell lines. We have tested HeLa and Vero cell lines based on their transfection permisivity, cell morphology, and ease of culture. HeLa was more suitable based on its origin (human uterine epithelial cancer cell line), while the Vero cell line is derived from kidney epithelial tissue of adult African green monkey (\textit{Cercopithecus aethiops}) \cite{Simizu1967CharacterizationVero}. Initial optimasition showed minimal transfection in HeLa cell line in each of the condition tested (data not shown), while the Vero cells were showing constant transfection, albeit with lower transfection efficiencies than what we observed in HEK293T cell line (circa 30\%/90\%, data not shown). Regardless, this was sufficient for confocal microscopy experiments.

Vero cells are ruitinely used to propagate and study a range of viruses, espoecially bRSV. Althogh it would be optimal to be detecting endogenous human IFITs interacting with RSV pseudo-IBs, IFITs of primates are phylogenetically more closely related to human IFITs that bovine IFITs \cite{Zhou2013InterferonDefense.}. Additionaly we have observed in the previous chapter that the interactions of human and bovine IFITs are fairly consistend. Thus assesing the monkey IFIT colocalisation with human or bovine pIBs could yield useful insights into the matter.

\end{figure}

We systematically observed and annotated a total of 1424 pseudo inclusion bodies across HEK293T (103 observations) and Vero (1321 observations) cell lines. The relationship between their measured area and radia can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Size Characterisation of Pseudo Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines}. pIBs observed in both cell lines broadly follow logaritmic curves, as expected based on the relationship of the observed values, although we can observe a sizable number of detected entities that show larger measured area compared to predicted radius. This indicates elongated ellipsioid shape. The pIBs detected in 293T cell line mainly exhibited the radia of 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the majority of the detected pIBs having their radia between 0.25 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\). With regards to their associated measured area, most of the pIBs were between 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). In the Vero cell line we can observe a higher spread of data as we have observed pIB measuring >5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) in radius and >300 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), however, majoprity of the detrected entities confronted to radia between 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 0.7 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the measured 2D area betweeen 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\).

    \label{fig:The Distributions of pIB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}
\end{figure}

A more detailed view focusong solely on the distribution of measured areas per cell line can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:The Distributions of pIB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}. We can see that pIBs detected in Vero cell line encompas larger range in terms of the minimal and maximal measured area copared to the 293T cell line, however, the median value in the latter was higher. In more detal, in 293T cell line we have measured pIB areas ranging from sub 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 20 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median value of 2.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), while in Vero cell line we have observed pIBs ranging from sub 0.07 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 300 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median value of 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Both median values are considerably smaller to what was observed in cell lines during infection (Section \ref{subsec:IFIT Subcellular Localisation During Interferon Induction and RSV Infection}, Figure \ref{fig:The Distributions of IB Areas Observed Per Cell Line}), which is in line to what was reported in literature where pIBs observed 24 hours post-transfection were considerably smaller than conventional IBs observed in infected cells after equivalent passage of time cite{Jobe2021BovineResponses}.

We obtained 16 observations of endogenous human IFIT1 and its interaction with hRSV pIBs in 293T cell line. The observed phenotype frequencies, along with the measured pIB sizes can be vewed n Figure \ref{fig:Phenotypic Interactions of Human IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the 293T Cell Line}, with the representative iimagese of these phenotypes shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Phenotypic Interactions of Human IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the 293T Cell Line}. A half of the observations displayed diffusion phenotype. This was predominantly observed in smaller pIBs with a typical size of 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and ranging from 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) in size. The second most prevalent phenotype was exclusion, which occured in 44\% of cases. The pIBs associatred with this phenotype closely clustered at around 2.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), whith two exceptions i.e. one very small pIB (0.22 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)) and one ralitaively large pIB (5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)). Lastly, we have observed one pIB with a measured area of 3.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) which exhibited size exclusion phenotype. Overall these data suggest human IFIT1 not associating with human RSV pIB structures, although this is based on a very limited set of observations.

Next we have evaluated endogenous monkey IFIT1 interactions with pIBs created by transfection of hRSV N and P proteins in Vero cell line. The frequencies of occurances of the interaction phenotypes based on 76 observations, along with the measured pIB areas per phenotype are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The representative images of these phenotypes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Human pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. 43\% of the observations show monkey IFIT1 forming intra pIB inclusion. This was followed by a diffusion phenotype, which occured in 38\% of observations. Further, 8\% of the observations showed monkey IFIT1 to be colocalisiong with the edge of the pIB structure while beiing excluded from the main pIB structure. Lastly, colocalisation and exclusion phenotypes both individually occured in 5\% of cases each. With regards to the size profile of hRSV pIBs associated with these phenotypes, inclusion was observed in a wide range of pIB sizes, ranging from sub 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 20 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median size of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The diffusion phenotype was observed in pIBs with a smilar range of measured areas, with an identical median value of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). These two phenotypes differ in the distribution of their values. While the pIB sizes of inclusion phenotype-associated pIBs were evenly distributed between its minimal and maximal values, diffusion-associated pIBs clustered at around 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The colocalisation associated with pIB exclusion phenotype occured in larger pIBs with the typical area of 9 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and was not observed in pIBs which were smaller than 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The colocalisation-phenotype associated hRSV pIBs as well were of larger size, with the median value of 6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), and minimal value of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Lastly the exclusion phenotype was was observed to be associated with 4 pIBs which had median 2D area of 1.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Overall, although in this simplified model, the size of the pIB should not directly mean a difference in the underlying pIB complexity. Regardelss we observe size-dependent phenotype association. In smaller, sub 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) pIBs we only observed inclusiohn and diffusiion phenotyeps, which were equally prevelant in these. Larger pIBs had inclusion, diffusion and colocalisation associated with exclusion associated with them.

Lastly we have observed monkey IFIT1 interaction,detected by human IFIT1 antibody, with bovine RSV pIBs, using the transfection of bRSV N and P containing plasmids. These plasmids consistently yielded lower transfection efficiencies and thus posed difficulties in obtaining a large amount of observations. Due to this we have failed to generate enough samples to investigate endogenous monkey IFTIs other than IFIT1 and IFIT2using the A antibody (with the respective results shown and discussed in Section \ref{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}). Regardless, the frequencies of occurances of the interaction phenotypes based on 14 observations, along with the measured pIB areas per phenotype are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Bovine pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}. The representative images of these phenotypes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Interaction Phenotypes of Monkey IFIT1 with Bovine pIBs in the VERO Cell Line}.

Nascent monkey IFIT3 seems to behave a if he pIB was not here. This means I has diffused phenotype. One exception is the top panel (shown with the arrow) which hints at concentrated IFIT3 at the edge of the pIBs. We do not know the localisation with respect to the pIB filaments as none were found in the slides. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

Nascent monkey IFIT5 colocalises with hRSV pseudo inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining). It also colocalises with pIB filamentous network. This network is only seen in cells that are co-transfected with RSV N and P proteins. We believe that they are an aftermath of a pIB breakdown. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

Overexpressed bIFIT3-FLAG was observed to colocalise with hRSV inclusion bodies (top panel; highlighted with arrows), as well as being excluded from the hRSV IBs, without any signs of IFIT3 signal on the periphery of the IB structures (middle and bottom panel). This data is supported by z stack measurements.

Very similar phenotype is observed for overexpressed bIFIT3-FLAG in bRSV infected cells. We see colocalization with IB (top panel) as well as exclusion from the structure without any signs of IFIT3 signal on the periphery of the IB structure (bottom panel). This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

hIFIT5-FLAG is colocalising with hRSV inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining), while in bRSV infected cell there is a hint of IFIT5 signal concentration at the side of bRSV IB.

This data is by single cells per conditions as transfection did not work well. It is however supported by z stack measurements.

% summary
Overexpressed hIFIT1-FLAG in the context of h/bRSV infection colocalises to both human and bovine IB structures.

Overexpressed bIFIT3 behaves equally between hRSV and bRSV infection, that is it sometimes colocalises with the IB structure and sometimes is completely excluded from the structure.

Overexpressed hIFIT5 in hRSV infected cells colocalises with the IBs.
