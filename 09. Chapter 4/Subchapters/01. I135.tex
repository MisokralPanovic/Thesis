\subsection{Monkey IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation in a Simplified System of Pseudo-IBs} \label{subsec:Monkey IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation in a Simplified System of Pseudo-IBs}


To investigate the intreaction of IFITs with RSV pseudo inclusion bodies ...

The cells, regardless of the cell line used were cultured and passaged using the standard conditions and procedures, as decribed in Sections \ref{sec:Cell Culture} and \ref{subsec:Passaging and Seeding Cells}. Human or bovine RSV N or P codon optimised ORFs, which were situated in pcDNA3.1 plasmid backbones, were transfected into the cells using TransIT-X2 in 1:2 ratio, as decribed in Section \ref{subsec:Transfecting Cells}. We have tried transfection with lipofectamine 3000 as well, although it was more toxic to cells and provided smilar transfection efficiencies (data not shown). After trying and optimising the transfection conditions in terms of total DNA used, seeding density and different ratios of RSV N and P containing plasmids (data not shown), we have ended up consistently transfecting 500 $\mu$g of each plasmid per 50k cells seeeded in 24 well plate per well.

The initial experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which were very persmisive to plasmid transfection and oftern displaying transfection efficiencies of >90\%. They are not really suitable for confocal microscopy and subsequent image analysis as they have small nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. They are also dfficult to work with as they easily detach from the plastic culture plates during treatment or washes. Regardless, the initial IFIT1 and IFIT2 (Section \ref{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}) staining experiments were conducted using these cells. Due to this we have transitioned into other cell lines. We have tested HeLa and Vero cell lines based on their transfection permisivity, cell morphology, and ease of culture. HeLa was more suitable based on its origin (human uterine epithelial cancer cell line), while the Vero cell line is derived from kidney epithelial tissue of adult African green monkey (\textit{Cercopithecus aethiops}) \cite{Simizu1967CharacterizationVero}. Initial optimasition showed minimal transfection in HeLa cell line in each of the condition tested (data not shown), while the Vero cells were showing constant transfection, albeit with lower transfection efficiencies than what we observed in HEK293T cell line (circa 30\%/90\%, data not shown). Regardless, this was sufficient for confocal microscopy experiments.

Vero cells are ruitinely used to propagate and study a range of viruses, espoecially bRSV. Althogh it would be optimal to be detecting endogenous human IFITs interacting with RSV pseudo-IBs, IFITs of primates are phylogenetically more closely related to human IFITs that bovine IFITs \cite{Zhou2013InterferonDefense.}. Additionaly we have observed in the previous chapter that the interactions of human and bovine IFITs are fairly consistend. Thus assesing the monkey IFIT colocalisation with human or bovine pIBs could yield useful insights into the matter.

We systematically observed and annotated a total of 1424 pseudo inclusion bodies across HEK293T (103 observations) and Vero (1321 observations) cell lines. The relationship between their measured area and radia can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Size Characterisation of Pseudo Inclusion Bodies Across Different Cell Lines}. pIBs observed in both cell lines broadly follow logaritmic curves, as expected based on the relationship of the observed values, although we can observe a sizable number of detected entities that show larger measured area compared to predicted radius. This indicates elongated ellipsioid shape. The pIBs detected in 293T cell line mainly exhibited the radia of 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the majority of the detected pIBs having their radia between 0.25 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\). With regards to their associated measured area, most of the pIBs were between 0.5 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). In the Vero cell line we can observe a higher spread of data as we have observed pIB measuring >5 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) in radius and >300 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), hopwever, majoprity of the detrected entities confronted to radia between 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}\) and 0.7 \(\mu \mbox{m}\), with the measured 2D area betweeen 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) and 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\).

Nascent monkey IFIT3 seems to behave a if he pIB was not here. This means I has diffused phenotype. One exception is the top panel (shown with the arrow) which hints at concentrated IFIT3 at the edge of the pIBs. We do not know the localisation with respect to the pIB filaments as none were found in the slides. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

Nascent monkey IFIT5 colocalises with hRSV pseudo inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining). It also colocalises with pIB filamentous network. This network is only seen in cells that are co-transfected with RSV N and P proteins. We believe that they are an aftermath of a pIB breakdown. This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

Very similar phenotype is observed for overexpressed bIFIT3-FLAG in bRSV infected cells. We see colocalization with IB (top panel) as well as exclusion from the structure without any signs of IFIT3 signal on the periphery of the IB structure (bottom panel). This data is as well supported by z stack measurements.

hIFIT5-FLAG is colocalising with hRSV inclusion bodies (basically resembling the P staining), while in bRSV infected cell there is a hint of IFIT5 signal concentration at the side of bRSV IB.

This data is by single cells per conditions as transfection did not work well. It is however supported by z stack measurements.

% summary
Overexpressed hIFIT1-FLAG in the context of h/bRSV infection colocalises to both human and bovine IB structures.

Overexpressed bIFIT3 behaves equally between hRSV and bRSV infection, that is it sometimes colocalises with the IB structure and sometimes is completely excluded from the structure.

Overexpressed hIFIT5 in hRSV infected cells colocalises with the IBs.
