\subsection{Nascent IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation During Infection} \label{subsec:Nascent IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation During Infection}
\subsubsection{Infection IFIT1}
Nascent human IFIT1 shows several distinct phenotypes with respect to the hRSV IB interaction. IFIT1 is either concentrated inside the structure (top panel), concentrated on the edge of IB ring (2nd and 3rd panels)  , excluded from the IB structure (4th panel),  or is diffused evenly between the cytoplasm and IB structure (bottom panel).

In this experiment the nascent bovine IFIT3 was consistently concentrated inside IBs. In some IBs the IFIT3 signal showed signs of sub-concentrations within the inclusions (bottom panel; highlighted with arrows), resembling IBAGs (inclusion body associated granules).

Subsequent experiments did not recapitulate the IFIT3 inclusions. It however shows signal which is almost identical to what is observed with IFIT5 in MDBKs during bRSV infection i.e., decrease, but not complete abolishment of IFIT3 signal inside the IB structure (top panel), and IB boundary exclusion while maintaining similar levels of signal intensity between cytoplasmic and intra IB stain.

\subsubsection{Infection IFIT5}
hIFIT5 seems to be excluded from hRSV IBs. There is a hint of accumulation of IFIT5 on the outside of IB (bottom panel; no z stacks to confirm this).

The distribution of bIFIT5 is equal between cytoplasmic stain and inside of the IB (with a hint of concentrations/substructures in top and bottom panel; no z stack data available). All 3 panels show a depression of IFIT5 signal at the side of IB boundary (highlighted by arrows).

\subsubsection{Summary} \label{Summary-infection}
In the context of infection, endogenous human IFIT1 concentrates within the human RSV IB structure; colocalises to the edge of the IB; is diffused through the structure and cytoplasm equally; or is excluded from the structure. This suggests that the interaction between human IFIT1 and hRSV IB is dynamic and depends on factors that we do not understand yet. In the case of endogenous bovine IFIT1 in the context of bRSV IBs, IFIT1 is either excluded from the structure; excluded from the IB inner edge but concentrated inside; or excluded from the centre of IB structure but concentrated on the inner edge of the structure. 

Nascent human IFIT3 during hRSV infection is either excluded from IB structure or is diffused through the structure. Occasionally it colocalises to the IB ring. Nascent bIFIT3 during bRSV infection either siphons inside IBs and shows sub-IB granules or is excluded from the IB boundary with slightly decreased signal inside of the IB.

In human cells during hRSV infection IFIT5 is mainly excluded from the IBs but seems to concentrate on their edge. Once we saw colocalization with the IB ring and a concentration of IFIT5 inside it. In bovine cells IFIT5 is always excluded from the IB boundary and the signal inside is either slightly decreased or equal compared to cytoplasmic IFIT5.
