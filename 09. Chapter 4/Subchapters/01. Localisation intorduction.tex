We observed it either concentrated inside the central point of the IB structure, while having reduced signal on the inner IB edge, compared to the cytoplasm (top and bottom panels), being excluded from the IB structure (3rd panel), or colocalising on the inner edge of the IB structure while having reduced signal in the middle of the structure compared to cytoplasm, or the edge staining (2nd panel).}
