\subsection{IFIT2 Localisation in the Context of RSV IBs} \label{subsec:IFIT2 Localisation in the Context of RSV IBs}
\subsubsection{Human Infection}
Nascent human IFIT2 shows 3 phenotypes with regards to colocalization with human RSV N. It seems to colocalise to the edge of the IB structure, with a partial signal also being detected in the inner edge of the structure (top panel); it completely colocalises to the N staining (middle panel; could be because the section is going through the top of the IB sphere); or forms inclusion inside the IB structure (bottom panel.

Nascent human IFIT2 colocalises with the ring structure (outlined by RSV P staining) and to the inner edge of the IB.

With regards of colocalization with human RSV M2/1 protein, human IFIT2 seems to either form inclusion, which has a signal decrease towards the middle of the IB structure (top panel), or seems to strongly colocalise with the ring structure highlighted by M2/1 staining (bottom 2 panels; there also seems to be IFIT2 signal concentration on the inner edge of the IB structure).

\subsubsection{Summary} \label{Summary-i2-infection}
Nascent human IFIT2 during hRSV infection consistently localises to the IB structure. It seems to have preference for the ring and the inner edge of the structure; however, we have seen it as homogenous inclusion as well. Endogenous bovine IFIT2 colocalises to the ring of the IB during bRSV infection.

Nascent human IFIT2 shows full or partial exclusion from human IBs during human RSV infection. Nascent bovine IFIT2 during bRSV infections shows 3 different phenotypes. We observed partial exclusion; exclusion from the IB ring and inner edge with IBAG-like inclusions; and diffusion through the IB structure. This staining is similar to what is observed with bovine IFIT3 and IFIT5 during bRSV infection.
