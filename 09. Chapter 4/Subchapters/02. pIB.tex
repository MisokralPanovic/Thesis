\subsection{IFIT2 Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs} \label{subsec:IFIT2 Localisation in the Context of RSV pIBs}
\subsubsection{Single transfections}
IFIT2 induction detected in hP and hP + hN conditions, suggesting that transfection of P induces IFIT2 expression (but this does not happen with IFIT1 or IFIT3 in the same cells).
About the different genomic regulation landscapeâ€¦ why does IFIT2 get induced but not other IFITs (within human genome which is well annotated)? 
Side note: No kinetochore microtubule staining (especially in first panel)

Nascent human IFIT2 strongly concentrates within the human RSV pseudo inclusion bodies.

Endogenous monkey IFIT2 colocalises with the pIB structure (probably like an inclusion), as well as with the pIB filamentous network.

\subsubsection{Summary} \label{Summary-i2-pib}
Both endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 forms inclusions inside human RSV pseudo-IBs. Monkey IFIT2 also colocalises to the pIB filamentous network (this structure was not observed in the human experiment). The identical staining can be observed in monkey cells with overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Endogenous monkey IFIT2 is excluded from human pIB and the pIB associated filamentous network. Overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG is detected by the antibody and shows inclusions inside the human pIB structures, which is consistent to data from IFIT2A staining and FLAG staining of IFIT2-FLAG overexpressed samples. Interestingly, IFIT2B antibody shows exclusion from the pIB filamentous network, which was colocalised by IFIT2A and FLAG antibodies.
