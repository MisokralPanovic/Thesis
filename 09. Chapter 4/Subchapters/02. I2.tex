\subsection{Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining} \label{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}
In Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} we have observed a strinking differential staining patternt between the two utilised anti-IFIT2 antibodies with regards to the observed interaction of IFIT with human or bovine RSV inclusion bodies. IFIT2(A) antibody showed both human and bovine IFIT2 to form intra-IB inclusions in smaller IBs, while it has observed IFIT2 to colocalise with the IB edge while being excluded from the IB centre of larger IBs. IFIT2(B) on the other hand predominantly detected IFIT2 to be excluded from the IB structures, indiscriminantly of the IB size. It has also occasionally showed IFIT2 to be equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the IB structures. Along to these, we have also observed a differenatial stainng pattern with regards to the general subcellular localisation of IFIT2 in mock-treated cells, which was more pronounced in the bovine cells. While we have observed general cytoplasmic staining of bovine IFIT2 by both antibodies, the IFIT2(A) staning alo revealed perinuclear concentations, which resemble the golgi aparatus. On the other hand, the IFIT2(B) antibody revealed IFIT2 to colocalise with the mitotic spindle. Clearly it seems like these two polyclonal antibodies are detecting two different entities. We believe these are two populations of IFIT2, basaly present in both human and bovine cells which are being detected by the antibodies based on differential epitope detecton. This could be due to one antibody detecting IFIT2 in the complex of its interaction partners such as IFIT1, IFIT3, MAVS, HOMER3, or double-strandeed RNA, while the other antibody detects naked IFIT2 entities. The precise nature, however, still remains to be elucitaded.

To iunvestigate this we initialy employed the same methodologies as were used in Section \ref{subsec:IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 Localisation with Regards to RSV Pseudo-IBs} i.e. we set to investigate the IFIT2 localisation with regards to human and bovine RSV pIBs, as detected by the IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) antibodies. We have utilised the HEK293T and Vero cell lines in which we probed for endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 respectively. We have induced hRSV pIBs in both HEK293T, and Vero cell lines utilising the transfection pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing ORFs for hRSV \textit{N} and \textit{P}, while have assessed the bRSV pIBs solely in Vero cell line. We have however failed to generate sufficient amounbt of bRSV pIB expressiing Vero cells to stain with both IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) andtibodies and thus the latter is missiing from the analysis. This could be due to contaminations in the plasmid preperations or decreased quality of these plasmids.

While conducting the fundemental control experiments consisting of asssesing the single RSV \textit{N} and \textit{P} transfectons, along with transfections with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid, while comparing these to mock-transfected cells we have uncovered another differentiation between IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) staining. We have observed IFIT2 induction as a response to transfection with hRSV \textit{P}-containing plasmid, which did not occur during the transfection with empty vector or hRSV \textit{N}-containing plasmid. This induction occured only in the cells where we dected hRSV \textit{P} expression. Interesingly, this was only detected using IFIT2(A) (Figure \ref{fig:IFIT2(A) Antibody Detects Increased IFIT2 Expression Following hRSV P Transfection}), while IFIT2(B) staining did not revel this phenotype (Figure \ref{fig:IFIT2(B) Antibody Does Not Detect Increased IFIT2 Expression Following hRSV P Transfection}). We conducted these control experiments for IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 which revealed staining patter consistent to what IFIT2(B) antibody observed (data not shown). Along to this, we can observe differential subcellular localisation of IFIT2 between the detection of the two antibodies, which is somewhat consistent to what was observed in Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} in the MDBK cell line. We have observed IFIT2(A)-stained HEK293T mock cells to show perinuclear IFT2 concentrations resembling lipid droplets or aggregosomes, based the definitions and expamples provided by the Human Protien Atlas \cite{Thul2017AProteome}. The IFIT2(B) antibody showed IFIT2 localising to the mitotic spindle. This data poses a few questions. Since the \textit{IFIT} genes should possess similar genomic regulation, through which mechanism does \textit{IFIT2} get induced following RSV \textit{P} exogenous expression? Is this mediated via the direct acxtion of the P protein and thus is this indicative to what happens during infection? This would imply that the \textit{hIFIT2} induction caused by RSV infection (from Chapter \ref{ch:Assessment of Transcriptional Induction of Human IFITs in the Context of RSV}) apperas predominantly in infected, P expressing cells and thus hnts at direct IFIT2 antiviral role against RSV. The other imnportant question is how is it possible that IFIT2(B) antibody is unable to detect this increased nascent IFIT2? If the previously mentioned differential target epitope, based on the IFIT2 interaction partners is correct, this would suggest that IFIT2(B) antibody detects IFIT2 complexes and thus is blind to the newly synthesised IFIT2, which did not have time to for this complexes yet. Further expreiments are required to validate this claim.

Next, we set to investigate the interaction phenotypes of IFIT2 with RSV pseudo IBs as detected by the two antibodies, firstly focusing on the signal detected by IFIT2(A) antibody. We have obtained 81 observation of human IFIT2 interacting with hRSV pIBs from HEK293T cell line. The observed phenotypes, along with their frequencies of occurances and the pIB sizes associated with phenotypic interactions that occur with higher than 5\% frequency are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Human IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in 293T Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}, with the represpentaitve images of the phenotypes occuring at more than 5\% frequency are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Human IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in 293T Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}. predominantly we have observed IFIT2 to form intra-pIB inclusion, a phenotype that occur in 98\% of cases. In the remaining 2\% of observations we have observed IFIT2 colocalising with the pIB boundry, while being excluded form the pIB centre. The sizes of inclusion-associated pIBs confront to the general distribution of all obsebserved pIBs in HEK293T cell line, ranging from 0.1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 25 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) in size, with the median area of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Unlike what we observed with monkey IFIT1 and IFIT5, where the inclusion and colocalisation associated with exclusion phenotypes seem to be restricted to small and large pIBs respectively, we do not see this discintion with endogenous human IFIT2. This suggest that IFIT2, as detected by IFIT2(A) antibody seems to form intra-pIB inclusions, irrespective of their size.

Next we investigated the monkey IFIT2 interaction with hRSV pIBs as detected by the IFIT2(A) antibody. To do this we trnasfected hRSV \textit{N} and \textit{P} containing plasmids to Vero cells. Doing this we have obtained 48 observations, all of which confronted to the inclusion phyenotype (Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}, panel a). The measured area of these hRSV pIBs is showin in Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}, panel b. The representative image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}. The distribution of the pIB sizes is almost indentical to the aggregate dataset of all pIBs observed in Vero cell line, ranging from sub 0.07 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 60 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the typical value of 1.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). This data is consistent to what we observed in HEK293T cells.

Finally we investigated the monkey IFIT2 interaction with bRSV pIBs as detected by the IFIT2(A) antibody. To do this we trnasfected bRSV \textit{N} and \textit{P} containing plasmids to Vero cells. Doing this we have obtained 38 observations, all of which confronted to the inclusion phyenotype (Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of bRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}, panel a).

The representative image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of bRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(A) Antibody}. Although the observed pIBs are not a perfect representation of the agglomerate of all pIB observations in the Vero cell line, they span across enough of the pIB size range that we can conclude that monkey IFIT2 forms intra-pIB inclusions regardless of their size. In more detail, their size ranges from 0.12 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 16 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median value of 1.8 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). In summary, IFIT2(A) andtibody detects IFIT2 to form intra-pIB inclusion regardles of the host or viral species or the IB size.

Next we focused on the assesment of IFIT2 interaction with hRSV pIBs as detected by the IFIT2(B) antibody. Initialy we assessed the human IFIT2 interaction to hRSV pIBs, aqured from HEK293T cell line. We have however obtained only 6 observations, all of which showed exclusion phenotype (Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Human IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in 293T Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(B) Antibody}, panel a). The measured area of these hRSV pIBs is showin in Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Human IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in 293T Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(B) Antibody}, panel b. The representative image of this phenotype is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Human IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in 293T Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(B) Antibody}. Although we only observed 6 pIBs, these encompasses the range where the majority of the total observed hRSV pIBs sizes were situated i.e. they ranged from sub 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to supra 10 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the typical value of 4 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\).

Finally we have assayed the endogenous monkey IFIT2 interactions with hRSV pIBs, as detected by the IFIT2(B) antibody. The observed interaction phenotypes, their respectife frequencies of occurance along with the pIB sizes denoted per observed phenotype are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(B) Antibody}. The representative images of these interactions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Representative Images of Observed Phenotypes of Endogenous Monkey IFIT2 in the Context of hRSV Pseudo Inclusion Bodies in Vero Cell Line, as Detected by IFIT2(B) Antibody}. Within the 76 observations we have observed two phenotypes i.e. exclusion and diffusion. The former was the most prevalent and appeared in 91\% of observations, while the latter occured in 9\% of cases. The exclusion phenotype in a wide range of pIB sizes, which are quite representative of the aggregate distribution of all pIB sizes detected in the Vero cell line. In more detail, they ranged from 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 21 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the typical size of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). The  diffusion phenotype, on the other hand, happened predominantly in smaller pIBs, ranging from 0.43 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 1 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with the median size of 0.63 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\).

Overall we have observed results of IFIT2 intraction with RSV pIBs which were very consistent to what was observed with endogenous human and bovine IFIT2 during RSV infection in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}. IFIT2(B) deteted endogenous human and monkey to be excluded from hRSV pIBs, with the exception of moneky IFIT2 where it also observed diffusion to occur in 9\% of all cases. IFIT2(A) antibody on the other hand detected IFIT2 to form intra-pIB solely regardless of the host species or the species of the virus, from which the pIBs originated. This is in contrast to what we observed during infection, where both human and bovine IFIT2, as detected byb the IFIT2(A) antobody, was observed to form intra-IB inclusions in smaller IBs and to colocalise with the IB edge while being excluded from the IB interior in larger IBs. Regardless, we can still see a stark discintion between observed IFIT2 using the two antibodies while we lack the understanding of what differentiate the two hypothetised IFIT2 popoulations. Clearly the current approach is not sufficient to uncover the nature of the differences observed by these two antibodies. By detecting a distinct epitope, such as FLAG tag, we would have ncreased confidence into detecting the whole IFIT2 population. 

To do this we utilised the human IFIT2-FLAG containing plasmid, which was provided to us by the Viral Gene Expressioin group from the Pirbright Institute and by bovine IFIT2-FLAG contang plasmid, which was prepared as described in Section \ref{sec:DNA Work} and Section \ref{subsec:Overexpressed IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 During RSV Infection}. We decided to initially assess these with the context of human and bovine RSV pseudo inclusion bodies, as these yieled more defined interaction phenotypes as detected by the IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) antibodies. We also decided for this approach as transfection of three plasmids (i.e. N, P, and IFIT2-FLAG containing plasmids) has higher efficiency than conducting co-infection/transfection. After overexpressing the FLAG-tagged IFIT2 this would allow us to not only probe the FLAG tag to obtain the ground truth about the IFIT2 subcellular localisation with regards to RSV pIBs, it would also allow us to probe with the IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) antibodies to probe if their differential IFIT2 detection remains unchanged.

% summary i2
We have described how bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant was designed based on the published human IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant data (needs to be annotated more). Overexpression of bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant yields cellular distribution and morphology similar to what was observed with overexpressing human IFIT2-FLAG, suggesting that the mutant proteins are not toxic to the cells. In the first experiment where we were looking at interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pseudo inclusion bodies we saw several phenotypes. We observed bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant being excluded from small and big pIBs and pIB associated filamentous network, while fully or partially colocalising with other pIBs. In a subsequent experiment we observed only colocalization and inclusion formation. When assessing the interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pIBs formed using wild-type human RSV P and GFP-tagged human RSV N, we observed consistently in two experiments that bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant colocalises to the pIB structures.
