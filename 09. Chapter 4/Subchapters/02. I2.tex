\subsection{Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining} \label{subsec:Dissecting the Differential IFIT2 Antibody Staining}


%Single transfections
IFIT2 induction detected in hP and hP + hN conditions, suggesting that transfection of P induces IFIT2 expression (but this does not happen with IFIT1 or IFIT3 in the same cells).
About the different genomic regulation landscapeâ€¦ why does IFIT2 get induced but not other IFITs (within human genome which is well annotated)? 
Side note: No kinetochore microtubule staining (especially in first panel)

% summary
Both endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 forms inclusions inside human RSV pseudo-IBs. Monkey IFIT2 also colocalises to the pIB filamentous network (this structure was not observed in the human experiment). The identical staining can be observed in monkey cells with overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Endogenous monkey IFIT2 is excluded from human pIB and the pIB associated filamentous network. Overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG is detected by the antibody and shows inclusions inside the human pIB structures, which is consistent to data from IFIT2(A) staining and FLAG staining of IFIT2-FLAG overexpressed samples. Interestingly, IFIT2(B) antibody shows exclusion from the pIB filamentous network, which was colocalised by IFIT2(A) and FLAG antibodies.

% exogenous
Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures as well as the pIB filamentous network. In this experiment we are detecting both human and monkey IFIT2, however we can see a huge difference in IFIT2 expression between some cells (bottom panel; cells in the periphery of the picture), suggesting that what we are mainly detecting is the overexpressed human IFIT2-FLAG.

Monkey cells transfected with human RSV N and P, along with human IFIT2-FLAG show concentration within the pIB structures but show exclusion from the pIB filamentous network (or partial colocalsiation?). This suggest that the IFIT2(B) antibody can indeed detect IFIT2 but the overexpressed IFIT2 observed between the inclusion and the one interacting with the filamentous network is somehow different (epitope masking?).

Exogenously expressed human IFIT2 colocalises with the pIB associated filamentous net (top panel). It also forms inclusion inside the human pIB structures. This data is consistent with what we observed with IFIT2(A) antibody. IFIT2 also seems to occasionally form aggregates/spots (highlighted by arrows). These could be functional or just aggregates caused by overexpression, we do not know.

% summary i2
We have described how bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant was designed based on the published human IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant data (needs to be annotated more). Overexpression of bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant yields cellular distribution and morphology similar to what was observed with overexpressing human IFIT2-FLAG, suggesting that the mutant proteins are not toxic to the cells. In the first experiment where we were looking at interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pseudo inclusion bodies we saw several phenotypes. We observed bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant being excluded from small and big pIBs and pIB associated filamentous network, while fully or partially colocalising with other pIBs. In a subsequent experiment we observed only colocalization and inclusion formation. When assessing the interaction between bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant and human pIBs formed using wild-type human RSV P and GFP-tagged human RSV N, we observed consistently in two experiments that bovine IFIT2 RNA-binding mutant colocalises to the pIB structures.
