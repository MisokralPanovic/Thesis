\chapter{Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions} \label{ch:Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter4}
In the preceding section, we established diverse interaction phenotypes of human and bovine IFITs with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies, varying from simple diffusion through the structures to the formation of intra-IB inclusions or colocalisation with IB boundaries. However, the frequencies of these phenotypes differed among the different IFITs and between human and bovine cells. Consequently, understanding the factors influencing these interaction phenotypes becomes imperative. One approach to unravel these influences is to examine IFIT interactions with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. These structures spontaneously emerge from the interaction of RSV N and P proteins, catalysed by RNA, leading to their formation \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Galloux2020MinimalVitro}. Despite their simpler complexity, RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies retain functional aspects observed in inclusion bodies, such as sequestering cellular proteins like MAVS and NF-\(\kappa\)B subunit p65 \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. Thus, they serve as a simplified model of RSV inclusion bodies.

Our objective is to investigate the localisation of IFITs with regards to human and bovine RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. We hypothesise that this analysis will offer a clearer perspective on the potential interaction of IFIT proteins with RSV inclusion bodies, as there are no additional viral factors that could interfere with IFIT association with (pseudo)inclusion bodies. Subsequently, we aim to evaluate the interaction of exogenously expressed human and bovine IFITs, each containing a detection tag, with inclusion bodies during human and bovine RSV infection. The utilisation of the detection tag is designed to eliminate the possibility that observed interaction phenotypes are due to off-target effects of anti-IFIT antibodies. This methodology will also showcase the maximal potential of IFIT interaction with RSV during infection, considering the abundant presence of IFIT proteins, allowing for the oversaturation of their binding targets and revealing where they genuinely interact.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter4}
In the preceding chapter (Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}), we observed diverse interaction phenotypes exhibited by both human and bovine IFIT proteins with human and bovine inclusion bodies. These phenotypes encompassed strong interactions, manifested by inclusion within the IB structure and colocalisation with the IB edge, as well as weak interactions, including diffusion and edge exclusion phenotypes. Conversely, the exclusion phenotype indicated that IFITs lack access to these structures. This chapter delves into dissecting the factors contributing to this diversity in interaction and evaluates the maximal propensity for interaction between human and bovine IFITs and human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies. To address the former, we visualised and quantified the interaction of endogenous human and monkey IFIT proteins with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies, simplified models representing RSV inclusion bodies. These models help ascertain whether, in the absence of RSV proteins other than N and P, IFITs interact with these structures. For the latter assessment, we exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged human and bovine IFIT proteins during human and bovine RSV infection. By elevating the concentration of IFIT proteins, we aimed to theoretically oversaturate factors actively impeding IFIT interaction with RSV inclusion bodies, thereby revealing the true propensity of different IFIT proteins for such interaction. Additionally, the use of anti-FLAG antibody detection mitigated potential off-target effects associated with anti-IFIT antibodies.

Previously, we observed both human and bovine endogenous IFIT1 to form intra-IB inclusions during their respective RSV infections, although the primary interaction phenotype was exclusion, not indicative of strong IB interaction (based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). Subsequently, we endeavoured to dissect and assess this differential interaction by examining IFIT1 interaction with a simplified model of inclusion bodies through the exogenous expression of human and bovine RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. We observed endogenous monkey IFIT1 to strongly interact with both human and bovine RSV pIBs, forming intra-pIB inclusions or colocalising with the pIB edge while being excluded from the centre of these structures. However, strong interaction phenotypes of endogenous human IFIT1 with hRSV pIBs were not observed. This discrepancy could be attributed to a differential underlying interaction profile between human and monkey IFIT1 with RSV pIBs or the limited quantity and size of observed hRSV pIBs. Subsequently, we investigated the interaction of exogenously expressed human IFIT1-FLAG with IBs during human and bovine RSV infections. In both instances, we commonly observed IFIT1 located in intra-IB inclusions, followed by diffusion and colocalisation associated with exclusion phenotypes. Surprisingly, when comparing these results with the endogenous human and bovine IFIT1 interaction profile with human and bovine RSV IBs, the proportion of phenotypes implying strong interaction increased in the exogenously expressed samples. We did not observe the occurrence of exclusion phenotypes in these instances. Overall, the latest data suggest that IFIT1 has the propensity to interact with pIBs and IBs; however, the levels of IFIT1 in infected cells may not be sufficiently high to interact with these structures. This suggests the existence of a N and P-independent system that prevents IFIT1 from interacting with these structures. However, if a sufficient concentration of IFIT1 is present in the cells, as is the case with exogenously expressed IFIT1, this overcomes the inhibition, resulting in IFIT1 mainly exhibiting strong interaction phenotypes with RSV inclusion bodies.

We observed endogenous human and bovine IFIT3 to rarely exhibit strong interaction phenotypes with human and bovine IBs (based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). Specifically, strong interaction phenotypes were observed in approximately 10\% of hRSV IBs and a higher percentage, around 25\%, in bRSV IBs. These findings were consistent with observations of endogenous monkey IFIT3 and its interaction with human RSV pseudo-IBs, where strong interaction phenotypes accounted for 22\% of all observations. This suggests that the interaction potential of IFIT3 with IB and pseudo-IB structures is not influenced by RSV proteins other than N and P. It could also imply that IFIT3 is passively recruited to these structures, possibly through biophysical interactions, or that recruitment is mediated by N or P interaction, or that some cellular protein recruits IFIT3 to the (pseudo)IBs. Regarding the localisation pattern of exogenously expressed bovine IFIT3 with human and bovine RSV IBs, we observed IFIT3 to manifest strong interaction phenotypes in 11\% of observations in hRSV-infected samples and 30\% in bovine RSV-infected samples, irrespective of IB size. This data closely aligns with what was observed with endogenous human and bovine IFIT3 during human and bovine RSV infection. However, it is essential to note that our observations of IBs were limited in terms of both quantity and size in co-infected/transfected cells. This limitation suggests that obtaining more observations in terms of quantity and diversity of sizes could reveal additional interaction phenotypes of bIFIT3-FLAG with RSV IBs. Conversely, it raises the possibility that IFIT3 negatively influences maximal IB sizes through an RSV IB interaction-independent mechanism.

The results concerning IFIT5 yielded the most interesting and intriguing findings. In the last chapter, both human and bovine IFIT5 predominantly exhibited exclusion and edge exclusion concerning human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies, respectively. Strong interaction phenotypes, such as inclusion or colocalisation associated with exclusion, occurred in approximately 15\% of observations. In the experiments presented in this chapter, where we investigated the localisation between endogenous monkey IFIT5 and human RSV pseudo-IBs, we observed strong interaction phenotypes in all 100 obtained observations. These phenotypes appeared to be separated by pseudo-IB size, with inclusion occurring in smaller pseudo-IBs and colocalisation associated with exclusion manifesting in larger pseudo-IBs; however, there was a notable overlap between these phenotypes. Regardless, this data strongly suggests that IFIT5 has an innate propensity to interact with pseudo-IB structures. Furthermore, we investigated the interaction phenotypes of exogenously expressed human IFIT5 with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies during infection. Unfortunately, we obtained very few observations in both hRSV and bRSV co-infected/transfected cells. Nevertheless, we observed strong interaction phenotypes along with the diffusion phenotype, which was most common in bRSV-infected samples. This indicates that endogenous and exogenous human IFIT5 exhibit distinctly different IB interaction phenotypes during RSV infection. This suggests that factors within the RSV hinder IFIT5 from associating with these structures during infection. However, in a system where IFIT5 levels are increased, this saturates the inhibition pathways. Notably, we failed to observe large IBs (>7 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)), implying that the elevated presence of human IFIT5 may prevent the formation of large IBs.

Next, we sought to comprehend the reason behind the divergent results obtained using the two anti-IFIT2 antibodies, IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B). In previous experiments, staining for endogenous human or bovine IFIT2 during human or bovine RSV infection (as detailed in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}) revealed both antibodies consistently displaying similar phenotypes. IFIT2(A) antibody consistently depicted human and bovine IFIT2 forming intra-IB inclusions in small IBs, colocalising with the edge of large IBs, while being excluded from their centres. Conversely, IFIT2(B) antibody consistently depicted IFIT2 as excluded from these structures. To investigate the differential staining pattern of these antibodies, we examined endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 with respect to human and bovine RSV pseudo-IBs, as detected by the two antibodies. The results were consistent with those observed during RSV infection, with the only difference being that IFIT2(A) antibody detected only the inclusion interaction phenotype, irrespective of pIB size. To further understand the differential staining pattern, we exogenously expressed human IFIT2-FLAG in Vero cells and assessed its interaction phenotypes with hRSV pseudo IBs. We visualised this protein using the anti-FLAG antibody to obtain the true localisation and then detected the exogenously expressed human IFIT2-FLAG using the IFIT2(A) and IFIT2(B) antibodies. Comparing the localisation detected by these antibodies to the ground truth obtained from the anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to comprehend the detection differences between the two antibodies.

The anti-FLAG antibody revealed that exogenous human IFIT2-FLAG was excluded from small pIBs located within the boundary of the nucleus, formed intra-pIB inclusions in medium-sized pIBs, and diffused evenly throughout the cytoplasm and pIB structures in 20\% of observations, irrespective of pIB size. IFIT2(A) antibody detected IFIT2 solely forming intra-pIB inclusions in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. IFIT2(B) antibody, however, detected phenotypes closer to the ground truth as detected by the anti-FLAG antibody. IFIT2(B) antibody detected IFIT2 either included in medium-sized pIBs or excluded from generally smaller pIBs, often located in the nucleoplasm. This suggests that the IFIT2(B) antibody detects phenotypes closer to the ground truth. Interestingly, overexpressing IFIT2 suddenly allows IFIT2(B) antibody to detect the inclusion phenotype, to which this antibody was previously blind. The reason for this phenomenon is currently unclear, but it could be that the presence of FLAG in the C-terminus of IFIT2 disrupts the creation of complexes to which IFIT2(B) antibody is blind.

We know, based on the technical datasheets, that the two polyclonal anti-IFIT2 antibodies were raised against different IFIT2 immunogens. IFIT2(A) antibody was raised against IFIT2 with both N and C-terminal truncations. Although the immunogen used retained the residues necessary for IFIT2 homodimer formation, the C-terminal truncation may have disrupted the C-terminal positively-charged nucleotide-binding channel of the IFIT2 homodimer. On the other hand, the IFIT2(B) antibody was raised against the N-terminus region of the IFIT2 protein, although the exact sequence is not publicly known. This information aids in pinpointing the regions of IFIT2 that are crucial for the differences observed between the two antibodies. Alongside the differences observed concerning RSV (pseudo)IBs, we also noted additional localisation phenotypes differentially detected by the two antibodies. Firstly, IFIT2(B) antibody detected IFIT2 colocalising with the mitotic spindle in human and bovine cells, consistent with literature reports on murine Ifit2 localisation \cite{Saha2006IdentificationProtein}. IFIT2(A) antibody did not detect this colocalisation; instead, it identified IFIT2 colocalising with Golgi apparatus-like perinuclear structures in the same human and bovine cells. Secondly, IFIT2(A) antibody detected an increase in signal following the transfection of hRSV \textit{P}-containing plasmid in HEK293T cells, whereas IFIT2(B) antibody failed to detect this signal increase. Collectively, this data suggests that these two antibodies are detecting two antigenically distinct IFIT2 populations, although the factors differentiating these populations remain unknown. Based on the different immunogens used for anti-IFIT2 antibody creation, we can speculate about the differential antigenic sites. Since the two antibodies show different populations, and the IFIT2(B) immunogen was raised against the N-terminus region of the IFIT2 protein, it is probable that IFIT2(B) detects the N-terminus of IFIT2, while IFIT2(A) antibody detects residues closer to the C-terminus.

Next, we focused solely on the IFIT2 detected by the anti-FLAG antibody. As mentioned earlier, exogenously expressed human IFIT2-FLAG predominantly exhibited minimal interaction phenotypes with respect to hRSV pIBs, although it detected IFIT2 forming intra-pIB inclusions in 35\% of observations. In contrast, exogenously expressed bovine IFIT2-FLAG mainly displayed strong interaction phenotypes with both human and bovine RSV pIBs. This surprising result hints at potential differential actions of human and bovine IFIT2. We then investigated whether RNA binding by IFIT2 is required for the occurrence of strong interaction phenotypes. Human and bovine IFIT2-RNA binding mutant ORF-containing plasmids were designed based on the human IFIT2 double mutant R292E/K410E, shown to abolish RNA binding in human IFIT2 \cite{Yang2012CrystalMechanisms}. Testing the bovine IFIT2-RNA binding mutant in the context of human and bovine pseudo-IBs revealed it forming intra-pIB inclusions in approximately 50\% of observations, colocalising with the pIB edge while being excluded from the middle of the pIB structure in 10\% of observations. The remaining observations included diffusion and exclusion phenotypes. Despite differences in the frequencies of observed phenotypes between exogenously expressed bovine IFIT2 and IFIT2-RNA binding mutant, the lack of RNA binding clearly does not abolish the occurrence of strong interaction phenotypes and is not the driving force behind them. Lastly, we investigated the interaction of exogenously expressed human and bovine IFIT2-FLAG with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies in co-infected/transfected cells. Interaction patterns differed both between exogenous human and bovine IFIT2 and from what was observed with endogenous human and bovine IFIT2 in Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}. Specifically, human IFIT2 diffused throughout hRSV IBs in 50\% of observations, while bovine IFIT2 exhibited the exclusion phenotype in 66\% and 80\% with hRSV and bRSV IBs, respectively. Human IFIT2 interacted with hRSV IBs through inclusion (20\% of observations) and colocalisation associated with exclusion (14\% of observations) phenotypes, while bovine IFIT2 showed only one strong interaction phenotype, colocalisation associated with exclusion with hRSV IBs. It is interesting that an increased concentration of IFIT2 actually leads to decreased interaction with RSV IBs, via a mechanism that remains not fully understood.

In conclusion, we observed endogenous monkey IFIT3 and endogenous human and monkey IFIT2 interacting with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies in a manner consistent with what was observed for endogenous human and bovine IFIT3 and IFIT2 during human and bovine RSV infection in Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}. Conversely, we noted that monkey IFIT1, and particularly monkey IFIT5, predominantly exhibited strong interaction phenotypes with these structures, more so than what was observed with endogenous human and bovine IFIT1 and IFIT5 during human and bovine RSV infection in Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}. This observation suggests that the factors determining the interaction profile of IFIT2 and IFIT3 with RSV IBs and pIBs are constant between the two structures. Moreover, while IFIT1 and IFIT5 exhibit a propensity to interact with these structures, certain viral factors prevent their association during infection. Additionally, we investigated the interaction of exogenously expressed human IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT5, along with bovine IFIT2 and IFIT3, with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies in co-infected/transfected cells. An overview of the observed interaction phenotypes of these proteins, along with their frequencies of occurrences, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Summary of the Interaction Phenotypes of Ectopically Expressed IFITs with RSV Inclusion Bodies}. It is essential to note, however, that observing cells that are both infected with RSV and transfected with plasmids, especially if transfected with IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, which were shown to have antiviral properties against RSV in the literature \cite{Drori2020InfluenzaProteins}, creates a bias towards cells and interactions that may not be representative of what happens \textit{in vivo}.

\end{figure}

Regardless, we observed exogenous human IFIT1 and IFIT5 to increase the occurrence of strong interaction phenotypes compared to what was observed with endogenous IFIT1 and IFIT5 during RSV infection in Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies}. This suggests that increasing the concentration of IFIT1 and IFIT5 oversaturates and counteracts the forces preventing them from fully accessing the IB structures. On the other hand, exogenously expressed bovine IFIT3 replicates what was observed with endogenous human and bovine IFIT3 during RSV infection. In more detail, it was mainly excluded or diffused through the IB structures; however, we consistently observed IFIT3 to show strong association phenotypes at around 10-30\% frequency. This, along with the pIB data, suggests that IFIT3 does not have a high innate propensity for association with pIB and IB structures. Therefore, we hypothesise that the subpopulation of IFIT3 that interacts with these structures is recruited there by some other cellular factors. One possibility could be the association with IFIT1 and IFIT2 proteins, as we observed both of those more commonly interacting with these structures. Lastly, we observed that increasing the concentration of human and bovine IFIT2 by exogenous expression led to a decreased proportion and frequency of occurrence of strong interaction phenotypes with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies. This could indicate that the IFIT2 interaction with RSV pIBs and IBs is mediated via protein interactions, which, if oversaturated, lead to the observation of more non-associated IFIT2.

Vero cells were infected with human or bovine RSV. At 24 hours post-infection, these cells underwent transfection with plasmids containing hIFIT1, hIFIT2, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in hRSV-infected cells, and hIFIT1, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in bRSV-infected cells. Subsequently, cells were fixed 24 hours post-transfection and imaged using a confocal microscope. The boundaries of IBs were identified using an anti-RSV N antibody.}

\end{figure}

Lastly, we speculate that overexpressing the IFIT proteins in the context of human and bovine RSV infection can provide us with an understanding of whether these proteins can restrict the maximal observed size of the RSV IB. Figure \ref{fig:Distribution_IB_Areas_coInfected_Transfected_Cells_IFIT_RSV} shows the IB 2D areas detected in co-infected/transfected cells, infected with either hRSV (panel a) or bRSV (panel b) in the cells where an increased concentration of FLAG signal was detected. Since, in the co-infection/transfection experiments, the cells were fixed 48 hours post-RSV infection, we should expect predominantly large IBs to be present in the infected cells, i.e., with the mean area of 22 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), as reported in \cite{Jobe2021BovineResponses}. However, we have detected IBs whose median areas ranged between 0.37 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 3.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). This by itself suggests that the increased presence of IFIT proteins negatively influences the IB sizes. We have observed different distributions of detected IB areas per overexpressed IFIT. In more detail, in hRSV infected cells where exogenous hIFIT1 was detected, the IBs ranged from 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 11 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with a median value of 1.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous hIFIT2 was detected, they ranged from 0.18 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 130 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous bIFIT2 was detected, they ranged from 0.11 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 32 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 1.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous bIFIT3 was detected, they ranged from 0.6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 12 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 3.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous hIFIT5 was detected, they ranged from 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 7 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 1.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Further, in bRSV infected cells where exogenous hIFIT1 was detected, the IBs ranged from 0.19 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 70 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\), with a median value of 1.6 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous bIFIT2 was detected, they ranged from 0.53 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 37 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 3.3 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous bIFIT3 was detected, they ranged from 0.15 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 11 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 0.37 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). Where exogenous hIFIT5 was detected, they ranged from 0.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) to 3.2 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\) with a median value of 0.73 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\). This data indicates that IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFIT5 could be negatively influencing the maximal potential IB sizes. To increase the certainty of these findings, it would be beneficial to gather more observations of IBs in cells that are overexpressing the IFIT proteins. Alongside this, it is vital to supplement these with proper controls, such as RSV-infected cells that were transfected with an empty control plasmid, and with the measurements of the RSV IB areas of non-transfected cells 48 hours post-infection.
