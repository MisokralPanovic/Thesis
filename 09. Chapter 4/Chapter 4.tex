\chapter{Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions} \label{ch:Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter4}
In the preceding section, we established diverse interaction phenotypes of human and bovine IFITs with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies, varying from simple diffusion through the structures to the formation of intra-IB inclusions or colocalisation with IB boundaries. However, the frequencies of these phenotypes differed among the different IFITs and between human and bovine cells. Consequently, understanding the factors influencing these interaction phenotypes becomes imperative. One approach to unravel these influences is to examine IFIT interactions with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. These structures spontaneously emerge from the interaction of RSV N and P proteins, catalysed by RNA, leading to their formation \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Galloux2020MinimalVitro}. Despite their simpler complexity, RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies retain functional aspects observed in inclusion bodies, such as sequestering cellular proteins like MAVS and NF-\(\kappa\)B subunit p65 \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. Thus, they serve as a simplified model of RSV inclusion bodies.

Our objective is to investigate the localisation of IFITs with regards to human and bovine RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. We hypothesise that this analysis will offer a clearer perspective on the potential interaction of IFIT proteins with RSV inclusion bodies, as there are no additional viral factors that could interfere with IFIT association with (pseudo)inclusion bodies. Subsequently, we aim to evaluate the interaction of exogenously expressed human and bovine IFITs, each containing a detection tag, with inclusion bodies during human and bovine RSV infection. The utilisation of the detection tag is designed to eliminate the possibility that observed interaction phenotypes are due to off-target effects of anti-IFIT antibodies. This methodology will also showcase the maximal potential of IFIT interaction with RSV during infection, considering the abundant presence of IFIT proteins, allowing for the oversaturation of their binding targets and revealing where they genuinely interact.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter4}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that's why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.

In Chapter \ref{ch:Subcellular Localisation of Endogenous IFIT Proteins in the Context of RSV Inclusion Bodies} we have observed both human and bovine IFIT proteins to ehibit diverse interaction phenotypes with human and bovine inculsion bodies, which ranged from strong interaction phenotypes (inclusion within the IB structure and colocalisation with the IB edge), through weak interaction phenotypes (diffusion and edge exclusion phenotypes), to the exclusion phenotype which implies IFITs do not have access to these structures. Here we tried to dissect the factors behind this diverse interaction and to assess the maximal propensity for interaction of human and bovine IFITs with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies. To do the former we have visualised and quantified the interaction of endogenous human and monkey IFIT proteins with RSV pseudo inclusion bodies. These structures are simplified models for RSV inclusion bodies and thus can indicate if during the lack of RSV proteins, other than N and P, IFITs interact with thes structures. To assess the latter, we have exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged human and bovine IFIT proteins during human and bovine RSV infection. By increasing the IFIT protein concentration this way we can in theory ovesaturate factors that are actively preventing IFITs from interacting with RSV inclusion bodies, and thus assess the true propensity of different IFIT proteins for interaction with these structures. Additionaly, by detecting these IFITs with anti-FLAG antibody we eliminated the potential anti-IFIT anibody off target effects.

Previously, we have observed both human and bovine endogenous IFIT1 to form intra-IB inclusion during the respective RSV infection, although the main interaction phenotype was exclusion, which was not indicative of strong IB interacton (based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). Following these results we tried to dissect and assess this differtial interaction by looking at IFIT1 interaction with the simplified model of the inclusion bodies by exogenously expressed human and bovine RSV pseudo inclusion bodies. We have observed endogenous monkey IFIT1 to strongly interact with both human and bovine RSV pIBs in the form of forming intra-pIB inclusions or colocalisation with the pIB edge, while being excluded from the centre of these structures. We have however not observed strong interaction phenotypes of endogenous human IFIT1 with hRSV pIBs. This could either be attributed to a differentional underlying interaction profile between human and monkey IFIT1 with RSV pIBs, or by the limited amount of observed hRSV pIBs in terms of size and quantity. subsequently, we have investigate the interaction of exogenously expressed human IFIT1-FLAG with IBs during human and bovine RSV infections. In both instances we most commonly observed IFIT1 to be located in intra-IB inclusions. This was followed by diffusion and colocalisation assocated with exlusion phenotypes. This is suprising, as if we compare these results with the endogenous human and bovine IFIT1 interaction profile with human and bovine RSV IBs, the proportion of phenotyeps ijmplying strong interaction is increased in the exogenously expressed samples. We neither observe exclusion phenotyoe to occur in these. Overall, the latest data sugest that IFIT1 have the propensity to interact with pIBs and IBs, however, the levels of IFIT1 in infected cells are not sufficiently high to interact with these structures. This suggest there is a N and P independent system which prevents IFIT1 from interacting with these stuructures, however, if sufficeint concentration of IFIT1 is present in the cells, such as in the case of exogenously expressed IFIT1, this overcomes this inhibition and results in IFIT1 mainly showing strong interaction phenotypes with RSV inclusion bodies.

% I3
We have observed endogenous human and bovine IFIT3 to rarely show strong interaction phenotypes with human and bovine IBs(based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). In more detail, we have observedg stron interaction phenotypes in circa 10\% of hRSV IBs, while this was higher in bRSV IBs (circa 25\%). These results were concistent to what we observed with endogenous monkey IFIT3 and its interaction with human RSV pseudo IBs. Here, the strong interaction phenotypes accounted for 22\% of all observations. This suggest that interaction potential of IFIT3 with IB and pseudo-IB strucutres is not influenced by RSV proteins other than N and P. It could also suggest that IFIT3 is recruited to these structure passively, perhaps via biophysical interactions with these structures, or that the recriutment is mediated via N or P interaction, or that some cellular protein recruits IFIT3 to the (p)IBs. With regards to the localisation pattern of exogenously expressed bovine IFIT3 with human and bovine RSV IBs, we have observed IFIT3 to confront to strong interaction phenotypes in 11\% of observations in hRSV infected samples, and 30\% in bovine RSV infected samples, irrespective of the IB size. This data is very consistent to what was observed with human and bovine endogenous IFIT3 during human and bovine RSV infection. However, it is important to state that we have observed limited amount and size of IB observations in co-infected/transfected cells. This could mean that there if we would obtain more observations in the amount and the diversity of sizes, we would be able to detect more interaction phenotypes of bIFIT3-FLAG with RSV IBs. On the other hand, this could imply that IFIT3 negaviely incluences the maximal IB sizes, which is mediated via RSV IB interaction-independent mechanism.

The results regarding IFIT5 yielded the most interesting and intereeging results. In the last Chapter, both human and bovine IFIT5 mainly exhibited exclusion and edge exclusion with regards to human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies respectively. The strong interaction phenotypes i.e. inclusion or colocalisation assocated with exclusion occured in circa 15\% of observations. In the experiments presented in this Chapter, where we investigated the localisation between endogenous monkey IFIT5 and human RSV pseudo-IBs, we only observed strong interation phenotypes in the 100 obtained observations. These seemed to be seperated by pIB size, with inclusion occuring in smaller pIBs, and colocalisation associated with exclusion appearing in larger pIBs, however, there was a marked overlap between these phenotypes. Regardless, this data strongly suggest that IFIT5 has a innate propensity to interact with the pIB structures. Further we investigated the interaction phenotypes of exogenously expressed human IFIT5 with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies during infection. We have unfortunaltely obtained very few observations in both hRSV and bRSV co-infected/transfected cells. Regardless, we have observed the strong interaction phenotypes along with the diffusion phenotype, which was the most common in bRSV infected samples. This means that endogenous and exogenous human IFIT5 show completely discint IB interaction phenotypes during RSV infection. This suggest that there are factors within the RSV that prevent IFIT5 from associating with these structures during infection, however, in a system where the IFIT5 levels are increased, this saturates the inhibition pathways. We have also failed to observe large IBs (>7 \(\mu \mbox{m}^2\)), which could indicate that the elevated presence of human IFIT5 prevents large IB formation.

% final conclusions
about the inherent trouble and selection bias with using infection transfection cos normal cells would not infect transfect

flag and gfp (of N) should show the same accessibility

the thing about N staining being ring but n-GFP is not
ifit-flag still shows coloc + excl so that phenotype appears to be real

oe:
if more i1 and i5 it promotes interaction
if more i2 it destroys interaction


i1 and i5 not sufficiently expressed to activate the mechanism that is guiding them to ibs

oversaturating association pathways leaves more i2 not associated (hints at viral protein associated transport?)

maybe i2 needs other ifits to do what it does - complex hypothesis

hence the litle interaction of i3, its mediated by i2 saturation

i123 cmplex - what we see with 3 is via interaction with i2

Vero cells were infected with human or bovine RSV. At 24 hours post-infection, these cells underwent transfection with plasmids containing hIFIT1, hIFIT2, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in hRSV-infected cells, and hIFIT1, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in bRSV-infected cells. Subsequently, cells were fixed 24 hours post-transfection and imaged using a confocal microscope. The boundaries of IBs were identified using an anti-RSV N antibody.}
