\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter4}


Again some intro to IBs and especially pIBs.

trying to understand the importance and involvement of i135 with IBs using simpler model where less other actions take place. 

Using pIBs as simpler model (only N+P+ cellular components) -> overexpression during infection

trying to disect the two antibody problem of IFIT2 and also discet it with the stuff mentioned above

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter4}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that's why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.

transfecting bi2f24 + bngfp + p inhibits bpIBs (compared to hi2f or bi2f)

PUT ABOUT IFIT2 KINETOCHORES

% random notes that will be useful later
IBs containing visible IBAGs were significantly larger than those without 6.4 um2 versus 2.3 um2 (Rincheval et al., 2017; hep2)
Although small IBs (-+2.5 um2) were observed as early as 6 h p.i., they did not colocalize with detectable levels of p65 (FJ thesis)
Our pseudo-IBs were also mostly spherical and at 24 h post-transfection, measured up to 6.9 um2 , which is considerably less than that of the conventional IBs observed in infected cells. (FJ thesis)
Visible aggregates measured above 3 um2 with the average size increasing as infection progressed (Fig 4.5B). At 48 h p.i., p65 aggregations had a mean area of 22.18 um2 but smaller puncta (<10 um2 ) were also observed, most likely the result of nascent infections in nearby cells. (FJ thesis)
Their mean area also increased to 8.99 um2 by 24 h p.i. (FJ thesis)

6h only N positive, mean 1; 16h n positive mean 1, n + p65 10; 24h n pos mean 1, n + p65 two clusters -> 2.5, 17 (FJ thesis)

stuff we tried but did not work: 
inf-transf bi1, hi3, bi5
pib with hi2f and i3-ha (ha signal not strong enough or trasnfection didnt work)
pib in 293t for other ifits (cells were dying and falling off)
hif2 and bovine pIB
experiments with human I2 RBM
in general bovine pIBs
hI2F with bRSV



\cite{Oliveira2013HumanCells} - IP of n p and m2/1 doesnt show ifits as interactors
