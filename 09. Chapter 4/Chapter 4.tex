\chapter{Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions} \label{ch:Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter4}
In the preceding section, we established diverse interaction phenotypes of human and bovine IFITs with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies, varying from simple diffusion through the structures to the formation of intra-IB inclusions or colocalisation with IB boundaries. However, the frequencies of these phenotypes differed among the different IFITs and between human and bovine cells. Consequently, understanding the factors influencing these interaction phenotypes becomes imperative. One approach to unravel these influences is to examine IFIT interactions with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. These structures spontaneously emerge from the interaction of RSV N and P proteins, catalysed by RNA, leading to their formation \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Galloux2020MinimalVitro}. Despite their simpler complexity, RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies retain functional aspects observed in inclusion bodies, such as sequestering cellular proteins like MAVS and NF-\(\kappa\)B subunit p65 \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. Thus, they serve as a simplified model of RSV inclusion bodies.

Our objective is to investigate the localisation of IFITs concerning human and bovine RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. We hypothesise that this analysis will offer a clearer perspective on the potential interaction of IFIT proteins with RSV inclusion bodies, as there are no additional viral factors that could interfere with IFIT association with (pseudo)inclusion bodies. Subsequently, we aim to evaluate the interaction of exogenously expressed human and bovine IFITs, each containing a detection tag, with inclusion bodies during human and bovine RSV infection. The utilisation of the detection tag is designed to eliminate the possibility that observed interaction phenotypes are due to off-target effects of anti-IFIT antibodies. This methodology will also showcase the maximal potential of IFIT interaction with RSV during infection, considering the abundant presence of IFIT proteins, allowing for the oversaturation of their binding targets and revealing where they genuinely interact.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter4}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that's why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.

% what we did
pib + oe
using simplified model and then altering the system (and using flag detecion for better clasity and minimal of target effects)



% I1
Overall, we have observed both human and bovine endogenous IFIT1 to form intra-IB inclusion during the respective RSV infection, although the main interaction phenotype was exclusion, which was not indicative of strong IB interacton (based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). Following these results we tried to dissect and assess this differtial interaction by looking at IFIT1 interaction with the simplified model of the inclusion bodies by exogenously expressed human and bovine RSV pseudo inclusion bodies. We have observed endogenous monkey IFIT1 to strongly interact with both human and bovine RSV pIBs In the form of forming intra-pIB inclusions or colocalisation with the pIB edge, while being excluded from the centre of these structures. 


IFIT1 summary OE + pIB + infecton

proobs if larger IB in hRSV OE coloc + excl would be more visible


good amount of inclusion in infection (a549 + mdbk)

no strong interaction in 293t but no large IBs
loads of iinclusion in vero hnhp
only strong interactions in bnbp

if more larger ibs in hRSV oe than both oe incl -  diff - coloc + excl
but presence of large IBs could mean that antiviral action not mediated via preventing large IB from forming

% I3
reasonably consistent results

minimal strong interaction phenotypes in infection (other than mdbk)

some strong interaction phenotypes in pIB

some strong interaction phenotypes in oe


very small ibs in oe so i3 could act ifit ndependently
small amount of direct interaction, maybe as a result of ifit123 formation?

% I5
infection mainly exclusion and edge exclusion (strong iinteraction >15\%)
mki5 + pib - only strong interacton

oe small amount of observations, but they suggest strong interaction

i5 seems lke it can interact with these structures and does when OE
also possibly decreases the ib size
maybe not enough i5 during infection to do the effect

IFIT5 summary OE + pIB + infecton

% I2
pib consistent with infection (a and B)
true loc with flag

atb differences:
golgi/lipid droplets vs kinetochores
P induction
stron size dependant interactions vs exclusion
interaction with nuclear IBs

how is it that sudenly i2b detects incl i2 when overexpressed?
- speculate what it can be based on:

i2ab antibodies
i2a - ATM-GEV (N/C trunc) - still 
i2b - N-term peptide

i2a detects c terminal enabled interactor complex

exo i2 (h and b and rbm) expression negatively influences pib size

i2f oe

% final conclusions
about the inherent trouble and selection bias with using infection transfection cos normal cells would not infect transfect

flag and gfp (of N) should show the same accessibility

the thing about N staining being ring but n-GFP is not
ifit-flag still shows coloc + excl so that phenotype appears to be real

oe:
if more i1 and i5 it promotes interaction
if more i2 it destroys interaction


i1 and i5 not sufficiently expressed to activate the mechanism that is guiding them to ibs

oversaturating association pathways leaves more i2 not associated (hints at viral protein associated transport?)

maybe i2 needs other ifits to do what it does - complex hypothesis

hence the litle interaction of i3, its mediated by i2 saturation

Vero cells were infected with human or bovine RSV. At 24 hours post-infection, these cells underwent transfection with plasmids containing hIFIT1, hIFIT2, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in hRSV-infected cells, and hIFIT1, bIFIT2, bIFIT3, and hIFIT5 in bRSV-infected cells. Subsequently, cells were fixed 24 hours post-transfection and imaged using a confocal microscope. The boundaries of IBs were identified using an anti-RSV N antibody.}
