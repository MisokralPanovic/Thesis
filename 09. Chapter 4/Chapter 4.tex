\chapter{Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions} \label{ch:Investigating the Nature of IFIT and IB Interactions}
\section{Background and Aims} \label{sec:Background and Aims-Chapter4}
In the preceding section, we established diverse interaction phenotypes of human and bovine IFITs with human and bovine RSV inclusion bodies, varying from simple diffusion through the structures to the formation of intra-IB inclusions or colocalization with IB boundaries. However, the frequencies of these phenotypes differed among the different IFITs and between human and bovine cells. Consequently, understanding the factors influencing these interaction phenotypes becomes imperative. One approach to unravel these influences is to examine IFIT interactions with RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. These structures spontaneously emerge from the interaction of RSV N and P proteins, catalyzed by RNA, leading to their formation \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Galloux2020MinimalVitro}. Despite their simpler complexity, RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies retain functional aspects observed in inclusion bodies, such as sequestering cellular proteins like MAVS and NF-\(\kappa\)B subunit p65 \cite{Rincheval2017FunctionalVirus, Jobe2023ViralCondensates}. Thus, they serve as a simplified model of RSV inclusion bodies.

Our objective is to investigate the localization of IFITs concerning human and bovine RSV pseudo-inclusion bodies. We hypothesize that this analysis will offer a clearer perspective on the potential interaction of IFIT proteins with RSV inclusion bodies, as there are no additional viral factors that could interfere with IFIT association with (pseudo)inclusion bodies. Subsequently, we aim to evaluate the interaction of exogenously expressed human and bovine IFITs, each containing a detection tag, with inclusion bodies during human and bovine RSV infection. The utilization of the detection tag is designed to eliminate the possibility that observed interaction phenotypes are due to off-target effects of anti-IFIT antibodies. This methodology will also showcase the maximal potential of IFIT interaction with RSV during infection, considering the abundant presence of IFIT proteins, allowing for the oversaturation of their binding targets and revealing where they genuinely interact.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions-Chapter4}
pIBs and IBs are dynamic structures and that's why we see variable interactions within the same IFIT experiments.

transfecting bi2f24 + bngfp + p inhibits bpIBs (compared to hi2f or bi2f)

% random notes that will be useful later
IBs containing visible IBAGs were significantly larger than those without 6.4 um2 versus 2.3 um2 (Rincheval et al., 2017; hep2)
Although small IBs (-+2.5 um2) were observed as early as 6 h p.i., they did not colocalize with detectable levels of p65 (FJ thesis)
Our pseudo-IBs were also mostly spherical and at 24 h post-transfection, measured up to 6.9 um2 , which is considerably less than that of the conventional IBs observed in infected cells. (FJ thesis)
Visible aggregates measured above 3 um2 with the average size increasing as infection progressed (Fig 4.5B). At 48 h p.i., p65 aggregations had a mean area of 22.18 um2 but smaller puncta (<10 um2 ) were also observed, most likely the result of nascent infections in nearby cells. (FJ thesis)
Their mean area also increased to 8.99 um2 by 24 h p.i. (FJ thesis)

6h only N positive, mean 1; 16h n positive mean 1, n + p65 10; 24h n pos mean 1, n + p65 two clusters -> 2.5, 17 (FJ thesis)

stuff we tried but did not work: 
inf-transf bi1, hi3, bi5
pib with hi2f and i3-ha (ha signal not strong enough or trasnfection didnt work)
pib in 293t for other ifits (cells were dying and falling off)
hif2 and bovine pIB
experiments with human I2 RBM
in general bovine pIBs
hI2F with bRSV

Subsequently, cells were fixed 24 hours post-transfection and imaged using a confocal microscope. The boundaries of IBs were identified using an anti-RSV N antibody.}

about the inherent trouble and selection bias with using infection transfection cos normal cells would not infect transfect

about stable and inducible cell lines and our try to make them but failing






the thing about N staining being ring but n-GFP is not
ifit-flag still shows coloc + excl so that phenotype appears to be real




if more i1 and i5 it promotes interaction
if more i2 it destroys interaction


i1 and i5 not sufficiently expressed to activate the mechanism that is guiding them to ibs

oversaturating association pathways leaves more i2 not associated (hints at viral protein associated transport?)

maybe i2 needs other ifits to do what it does - complex hypothesis





- conclusions of i1 i3 and i5
I1
Overall, we have observed both human and bovine endogenous IFIT1 to form intra-IB inclusion during the respective RSV infection, although the main interaction phenotype was exclusion, which was not indicative of strong IB interacton (based on the results in Section \ref{subsec:Endogenous IFIT Interaction with RSV Inclusion Bodies}). Following these results we tried to dissect and assess this differtial interaction by looking at IFIT1 interaction with the simplified model of the inclusion bodies by exogenously expressed human and bovine RSV pseudo inclusion bodies. We have observed endogenous monkey IFIT1 to strongly interact with both human and bovine RSV pIBs In the form of forming intra-pIB inclusions or colocalisation with the pIB edge, while being excluded from the centre of these structures. 


IFIT1 summary OE + pIB + infecton

proobs if larger IB in hRSV OE coloc + excl would be more visible


good amount of inclusion in infection (a549 + mdbk)

no strong interaction in 293t but no large IBs
loads of iinclusion in vero hnhp
only strong interactions in bnbp

if more larger ibs in hRSV oe than both oe incl -  diff - coloc + excl
but presence of large IBs could mean that antiviral action not mediated via preventing large IB from forming

I3
reasonably consistent results

minimal strong interaction phenotypes in infection (other than mdbk)

some strong interaction phenotypes in pIB

some strong interaction phenotypes in oe


very small ibs in oe so i3 could act ifit ndependently
small amount of direct interaction, maybe as a result of ifit123 formation?

I5
infection mainly exclusion and edge exclusion (strong iinteraction >15\%)
mki5 + pib - only strong interacton

oe small amount of observations

i5 seems lke it can interact with these structures and does when OE
also possibly decreases the ib size
maybe not enough i5 during infection to do the effect

IFIT5 summary OE + pIB + infecton





i2ab antibodies
i2a - ATM-GEV (N/C trunc)
i2b - N-term

i2a detects c terminal enabled interactor complex


exo i2 (h and b and rbm) expression negatively influences pib size


flag and gfp (of N) should show the same accessibility
